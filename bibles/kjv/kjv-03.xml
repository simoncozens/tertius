  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, <i>even</i> of the herd, and of the flock.</verse>
    <verse num="3">If his offering <i>be</i> a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that <i>is by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that <i>is</i> on the fire which <i>is</i> upon the altar:</verse>
    <verse num="9">But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, <i>to be</i> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And if his offering <i>be</i> of the flocks, <i>namely,</i> of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that <i>is</i> on the fire which <i>is</i> upon the altar:</verse>
    <verse num="13">But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring <i>it</i> all, and burn <i>it</i> upon the altar: it <i>is</i> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD <i>be</i> of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn <i>it</i> on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, <i>but</i> shall not divide <i>it</i> asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that <i>is</i> upon the fire: it <i>is</i> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be <i>of</i> fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:</verse>

    <verse num="12">As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, <i>even</i> corn beaten out of full ears.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it <i>is</i> a meat offering.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, <i>part</i> of the beaten corn thereof, and <i>part</i> of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: <i>it is</i> an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</verse>

    <verse num="3">And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Moses said unto the congregation, This <i>is</i> the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound <i>it</i> unto him therewith.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, <i>even</i> upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that <i>was</i> therein, and sanctified them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he slew <i>it;</i> and Moses took the blood, and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he took all the fat that <i>was</i> upon the inwards, and caul <i>above</i> the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned <i>it</i> upon the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</verse>

  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass on the eighth day, <i>that</i> Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</verse>

    <verse num="3">And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, <i>both</i> of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</verse>
    <verse num="4">Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they brought <i>that</i> which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</verse>

    <verse num="7">And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which <i>was</i> for himself.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put <i>it</i> upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:</verse>
    <verse num="10">But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt <i>them</i> upon the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt <i>them</i> upon the burnt offering on the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which <i>was</i> the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt <i>it</i> upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</verse>
    <verse num="18">He slew also the bullock and the ram <i>for</i> a sacrifice of peace offerings, which <i>was</i> for the people: and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</verse>

    <verse num="22">And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: <i>which</i> when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</verse>

  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.</verse>

    <verse num="3">Then Moses said unto Aaron, This <i>is it</i> that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</verse>
    <verse num="5">So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD <i>is</i> upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: <i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever throughout your generations:</verse>

    <verse num="12">And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it <i>is</i> most holy:</verse>
    <verse num="13">And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it <i>is</i> thy due, and thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for <i>they be</i> thy due, and thy sons’ due, <i>which</i> are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="15">The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave <i>it for</i> a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron <i>which were</i> left <i>alive,</i> saying,</verse>
    <verse num="17">Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it <i>is</i> most holy, and <i>God</i> hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?</verse>
    <verse num="18">Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy <i>place:</i> ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy <i>place,</i> as I commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and <i>if</i> I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?</verse>

    <verse num="16">I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:</verse>
    <verse num="20">And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</verse>
    <verse num="22">I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your <i>high</i> ways shall be desolate.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of <i>my</i> covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</verse>
    <verse num="26"><i>And</i> when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver <i>you</i> your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; <i>even</i> then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</verse>
    <verse num="35">As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And upon them that are left <i>alive</i> of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</verse>
    <verse num="38">And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</verse>
    <verse num="40">If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;</verse>
    <verse num="41">And <i>that</i> I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:</verse>
    <verse num="42">Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</verse>
    <verse num="43">The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</verse>
    <verse num="44">And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I <i>am</i> the LORD their God.</verse>
    <verse num="45">But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="46">These <i>are</i> the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="27">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons <i>shall be</i> for the LORD by thy estimation.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And if it <i>be</i> a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And if <i>it be</i> from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And if <i>it be</i> from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation <i>shall be</i> three shekels of silver.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And if <i>it be</i> from sixty years old and above; if <i>it be</i> a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And if <i>it be</i> a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that <i>any man</i> giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</verse>
    <verse num="10">He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And if <i>it be</i> any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, <i>who art</i> the priest, so shall it be.</verse>
    <verse num="13">But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth <i>part</i> thereof unto thy estimation.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And when a man shall sanctify his house <i>to be</i> holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth <i>part</i> of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD <i>some part</i> of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed <i>shall be valued</i> at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
    <verse num="17">If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.</verse>
    <verse num="18">But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth <i>part</i> of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</verse>
    <verse num="21">But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And if <i>a man</i> sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which <i>is</i> not of the fields of his possession;</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, <i>even</i> unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, <i>as</i> a holy thing unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="24">In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, <i>even</i> to him to whom the possession of the land <i>did belong. </i></verse>
    <verse num="25">And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether <i>it be</i> ox, or sheep: it <i>is</i> the LORD’S.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And if <i>it be</i> of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth <i>part</i> of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, <i>both</i> of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing <i>is</i> most holy unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="29">None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; <i>but</i> shall surely be put to death.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And all the tithe of the land, <i>whether</i> of the seed of the land, <i>or</i> of the fruit of the tree, <i>is</i> the LORD’S: <i>it is</i> holy unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And if a man will at all redeem <i>ought</i> of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth <i>part</i> thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, <i>even</i> of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="33">He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
