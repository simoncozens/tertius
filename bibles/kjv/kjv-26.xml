  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth <i>month,</i> in the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, as I <i>was</i> among the captives by the river of Chebar, <i>that</i> the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
    <verse num="2">In the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, which <i>was</i> the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,</verse>
    <verse num="3">The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness <i>was</i> about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Also out of the midst thereof <i>came</i> the likeness of four living creatures. And this <i>was</i> their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And their feet <i>were</i> straight feet; and the sole of their feet <i>was</i> like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And <i>they had</i> the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Their wings <i>were</i> joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</verse>
    <verse num="10">As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Thus <i>were</i> their faces: and their wings <i>were</i> stretched upward; two <i>wings</i> of every one <i>were</i> joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; <i>and</i> they turned not when they went.</verse>
    <verse num="13">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance <i>was</i> like burning coals of fire, <i>and</i> like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</verse>
    <verse num="16">The appearance of the wheels and their work <i>was</i> like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
    <verse num="17">When they went, they went upon their four sides: <i>and</i> they turned not when they went.</verse>
    <verse num="18">As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings <i>were</i> full of eyes round about them four.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither <i>was their</i> spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in the wheels.</verse>
    <verse num="21">When those went, <i>these</i> went; and when those stood, <i>these</i> stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in the wheels.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature <i>was</i> as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And under the firmament <i>were</i> their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And there was a voice from the firmament that <i>was</i> over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And above the firmament that <i>was</i> over their heads <i>was</i> the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne <i>was</i> the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</verse>
    <verse num="28">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so <i>was</i> the appearance of the brightness round about. This <i>was</i> the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw <i>it,</i> I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</verse>

  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, <i>even</i> unto this very day.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For <i>they are</i> impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns <i>be</i> with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they <i>be</i> a rebellious house.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they <i>are</i> most rebellious.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And when I looked, behold, an hand <i>was</i> sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book <i>was</i> therein;</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he spread it before me; and it <i>was</i> written within and without: and <i>there was</i> written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat <i>it;</i> and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For thou <i>art</i> not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, <i>but</i> to the house of Israel;</verse>
    <verse num="6">Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel <i>are</i> impudent and hardhearted.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</verse>
    <verse num="9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they <i>be</i> a rebellious house.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, <i>saying,</i> Blessed <i>be</i> the glory of the LORD from his place.</verse>
    <verse num="13"><i>I heard</i> also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</verse>
    <verse num="14">So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="17">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
    <verse num="18">When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Again, When a righteous <i>man</i> doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous <i>man,</i> that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</verse>
    <verse num="25">But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</verse>
    <verse num="26">And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.</verse>
    <verse num="27">But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, <i>even</i> Jerusalem:</verse>
    <verse num="2">And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set <i>battering</i> rams against it round about.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This <i>shall be</i> a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: <i>according</i> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm <i>shall be</i> uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, <i>according</i> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And thy meat which thou shalt eat <i>shall be</i> by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And thou shalt eat it <i>as</i> barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</verse>
    <verse num="17">That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber’s razor, and cause <i>it</i> to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the <i>hair. </i></verse>
    <verse num="2">Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, <i>and</i> smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; <i>for</i> thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Thus saith the Lord GOD; This <i>is</i> Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries <i>that are</i> round about her.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that <i>are</i> round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that <i>are</i> round about you, <i>and</i> have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that <i>are</i> round about you;</verse>
    <verse num="8">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, <i>am</i> against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Wherefore, <i>as</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish <i>thee;</i> neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</verse>
    <verse num="12">A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i> in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that <i>are</i> round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that <i>are</i> round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="16">When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for <i>their</i> destruction, <i>and</i> which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:</verse>
    <verse num="17">So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken <i>it.</i></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</verse>
    <verse num="3">And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, <i>even</i> I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain <i>men</i> before your idols.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</verse>
    <verse num="6">In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have <i>some</i> that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, <i>and that</i> I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
    <verse num="12">He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then shall ye know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when their slain <i>men</i> shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.</verse>
    <verse num="14">So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>

  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="22">My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret <i>place:</i> for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and <i>there shall be</i> none.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</verse>
    <verse num="27">The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>

  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth <i>month,</i> in the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>as</i> I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where <i>was</i> the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</verse>
    <verse num="6">He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? <i>even</i> the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, <i>and</i> thou shalt see greater abominations.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, <i>and</i> thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’S house which <i>was</i> toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen <i>this,</i> O son of man? turn thee yet again, <i>and</i> thou shalt see greater abominations than these.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, <i>were</i> about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen <i>this,</i> O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, <i>yet</i> will I not hear them.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man <i>with</i> his destroying weapon in his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them <i>was</i> clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which <i>had</i> the writer’s inkhorn by his side;</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:</verse>
    <verse num="6">Slay utterly old <i>and</i> young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom <i>is</i> the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which <i>were</i> before the house.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah <i>is</i> exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, <i>but</i> I will recompense their way upon their head.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which <i>had</i> the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, <i>even</i> under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter <i>them</i> over the city. And he went in in my sight.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, <i>and stood</i> over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’S glory.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard <i>even</i> to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And <i>one</i> cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that <i>was</i> between the cherubims, and took <i>thereof,</i> and put <i>it</i> into the hands of <i>him that was</i> clothed with linen: who took <i>it,</i> and went out.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under their wings.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels <i>was</i> as the colour of a beryl stone.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And <i>as for</i> their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.</verse>
    <verse num="11">When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, <i>were</i> full of eyes round about, <i>even</i> the wheels that they four had.</verse>
    <verse num="13">As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And every one had four faces: the first face <i>was</i> the face of a cherub, and the second face <i>was</i> the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the cherubims were lifted up. This <i>is</i> the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.</verse>
    <verse num="17">When they stood, <i>these</i> stood; and when they were lifted up, <i>these</i> lifted up themselves <i>also:</i> for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also <i>were</i> beside them, and <i>every one</i> stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’S house; and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> over them above.</verse>
    <verse num="20">This <i>is</i> the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they <i>were</i> the cherubims.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man <i>was</i> under their wings.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the likeness of their faces <i>was</i> the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD’S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then said he unto me, Son of man, these <i>are</i> the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:</verse>

    <verse num="4">Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, <i>every one of</i> them.</verse>

    <verse num="7">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they <i>are</i> the flesh, and this <i>city is</i> the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</verse>

    <verse num="13">And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</verse>
    <verse num="14">Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="15">Son of man, thy brethren, <i>even</i> thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, <i>are</i> they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:</verse>
    <verse num="20">That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</verse>
    <verse num="21">But <i>as for them</i> whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> over them above.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which <i>is</i> on the east side of the city.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.</verse>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they <i>be</i> a rebellious house.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.</verse>
    <verse num="6">In their sight shalt thou bear <i>it</i> upon <i>thy</i> shoulders, <i>and</i> carry <i>it</i> forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee <i>for</i> a sign unto the house of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought <i>it</i> forth in the twilight, <i>and</i> I bare <i>it</i> upon <i>my</i> shoulder in their sight.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?</verse>
    <verse num="10">Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden <i>concerneth</i> the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that <i>are</i> among them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Say, I <i>am</i> your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove <i>and</i> go into captivity.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the prince that <i>is</i> among them shall bear upon <i>his</i> shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with <i>his</i> eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="13">My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon <i>to</i> the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And I will scatter toward every wind all that <i>are</i> about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.</verse>
    <verse num="16">But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="18">Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;</verse>
    <verse num="19">And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, <i>and</i> of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="22">Son of man, what <i>is</i> that proverb <i>that</i> ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?</verse>
    <verse num="23">Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.</verse>

    <verse num="25">For I <i>am</i> the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="27">Son of man, behold, <i>they of</i> the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth <i>is</i> for many days <i>to come,</i> and he prophesieth of the times <i>that are</i> far off.</verse>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!</verse>
    <verse num="4">O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="6">They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made <i>others</i> to hope that they would confirm the word.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith <i>it;</i> albeit I have not spoken?</verse>
    <verse num="8">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I <i>am</i> against you, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and <i>there was</i> no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered <i>morter: </i></verse>
    <verse num="11">Say unto them which daub it with untempered <i>morter,</i> that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="12">Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where <i>is</i> the daubing wherewith ye have daubed <i>it? </i></verse>
    <verse num="13">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend <i>it</i> with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in <i>my</i> fury to consume <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="14">So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered <i>morter,</i> and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered <i>morter,</i> and will say unto you, The wall <i>is</i> no <i>more,</i> neither they that daubed it;</verse>
    <verse num="16"><i>To wit,</i> the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and <i>there is</i> no peace, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,</verse>
    <verse num="18">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the <i>women</i> that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive <i>that come</i> unto you?</verse>
    <verse num="19">And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear <i>your</i> lies?</verse>

    <verse num="4">And <i>as for</i> thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple <i>thee;</i> thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</verse>
    <verse num="5">None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee <i>when thou wast</i> in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee <i>when thou wast</i> in thy blood, Live.</verse>
    <verse num="7">I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: <i>thy</i> breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou <i>wast</i> naked and bare.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time <i>was</i> the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</verse>
    <verse num="10">I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.</verse>
    <verse num="11">I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment <i>was of</i> fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it <i>was</i> perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: <i>the like things</i> shall not come, neither shall it be so.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,</verse>
    <verse num="18">And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.</verse>
    <verse num="19">My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, <i>wherewith</i> I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and <i>thus</i> it was, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. <i>Is this</i> of thy whoredoms a small matter,</verse>
    <verse num="21">That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through <i>the fire</i> for them?</verse>
    <verse num="22">And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, <i>and</i> wast polluted in thy blood.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)</verse>
    <verse num="24"><i>That</i> thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary <i>food,</i> and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.</verse>
    <verse num="30">How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these <i>things,</i> the work of an imperious whorish woman;</verse>
    <verse num="31">In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;</verse>
    <verse num="32"><i>But as</i> a wife that committeth adultery, <i>which</i> taketh strangers instead of her husband!</verse>
    <verse num="33">They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And the contrary is in thee from <i>other</i> women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</verse>
    <verse num="36">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;</verse>
    <verse num="37">Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all <i>them</i> that thou hast loved, with all <i>them</i> that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</verse>
    <verse num="38">And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.</verse>
    <verse num="40">They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.</verse>
    <verse num="42">So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these <i>things;</i> behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon <i>thine</i> head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.</verse>
    <verse num="44">Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use <i>this</i> proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, <i>so is</i> her daughter.</verse>
    <verse num="45">Thou <i>art</i> thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou <i>art</i> the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother <i>was</i> an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</verse>
    <verse num="46">And thine elder sister <i>is</i> Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, <i>is</i> Sodom and her daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="47">Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as <i>if that were</i> a very little <i>thing,</i> thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</verse>
    <verse num="48"><i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="49">Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</verse>
    <verse num="50">And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw <i>good. </i></verse>
    <verse num="51">Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.</verse>
    <verse num="52">Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</verse>
    <verse num="53">When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then <i>will I bring again</i> the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:</verse>
    <verse num="54">That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="55">When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.</verse>
    <verse num="56">For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,</verse>
    <verse num="57">Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of <i>thy</i> reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all <i>that are</i> round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.</verse>
    <verse num="58">Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="59">For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</verse>
    <verse num="60">Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.</verse>
    <verse num="61">Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.</verse>
    <verse num="62">And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD:</verse>
    <verse num="63">That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>

  <chapter num="17">
    <verse num="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;</verse>
    <verse num="3">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:</verse>
    <verse num="4">He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed <i>it</i> by great waters, <i>and</i> set it <i>as</i> a willow tree.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</verse>
    <verse num="7">There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.</verse>
    <verse num="8">It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Yea, behold, <i>being</i> planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="12">Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these <i>things mean?</i> tell <i>them,</i> Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;</verse>
    <verse num="13">And hath taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:</verse>
    <verse num="14">That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, <i>but</i> that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such <i>things?</i> or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?</verse>
    <verse num="16">As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place <i>where</i> the king <i>dwelleth</i> that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, <i>even</i> with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Neither shall Pharaoh with <i>his</i> mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:</verse>
    <verse num="18">Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these <i>things,</i> he shall not escape.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; <i>As</i> I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken <i>it.</i></verse>
    <verse num="22">Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set <i>it;</i> I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant <i>it</i> upon an high mountain and eminent:</verse>
    <verse num="23">In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done <i>it.</i></verse>

    <verse num="1">The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?</verse>
    <verse num="3"><i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have <i>occasion</i> any more to use this proverb in Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,</verse>
    <verse num="6"><i>And</i> hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour’s wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,</verse>
    <verse num="7">And hath not oppressed any, <i>but</i> hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;</verse>
    <verse num="8">He <i>that</i> hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, <i>that</i> hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,</verse>
    <verse num="9">Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he <i>is</i> just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="10">If he beget a son <i>that is</i> a robber, a shedder of blood, and <i>that</i> doeth the like to <i>any</i> one of these <i>things, </i></verse>
    <verse num="11">And that doeth not any of those <i>duties,</i> but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour’s wife,</verse>
    <verse num="12">Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,</verse>
    <verse num="13">Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Now, lo, <i>if</i> he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,</verse>
    <verse num="15"><i>That</i> hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour’s wife,</verse>
    <verse num="16">Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, <i>but</i> hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,</verse>
    <verse num="17"><i>That</i> hath taken off his hand from the poor, <i>that</i> hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.</verse>
    <verse num="18"><i>As for</i> his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, <i>and</i> hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.</verse>
    <verse num="20">The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</verse>
    <verse num="22">All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: <i>and</i> not that he should return from his ways, and live?</verse>
    <verse num="24">But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, <i>and</i> doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked <i>man</i> doeth, shall he live?

    <verse num="25">Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?</verse>
    <verse num="26">When a righteous <i>man</i> turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Again, when the wicked <i>man</i> turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</verse>

    <verse num="30">Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn <i>yourselves</i> from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</verse>

    <verse num="1">And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth <i>month,</i> the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.</verse>

    <verse num="3">Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge <i>them?</i> cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:</verse>
    <verse num="5">And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I <i>am</i> the LORD your God;</verse>
    <verse num="6">In the day <i>that</i> I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which <i>is</i> the glory of all lands:</verse>

    <verse num="9">But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they <i>were,</i> in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</verse>

    <verse num="26">And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through <i>the fire</i> all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.</verse>
    <verse num="28"><i>For</i> when I had brought them into the land, <i>for</i> the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then I said unto them, What <i>is</i> the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?</verse>
    <verse num="31">For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.</verse>
    <verse num="33"><i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:</verse>
    <verse num="34">And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:</verse>
    <verse num="38">And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="39">As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter <i>also,</i> if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.</verse>
    <verse num="40">For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.</verse>
    <verse num="41">I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.</verse>
    <verse num="42">And ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country <i>for</i> the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.</verse>
    <verse num="43">And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.</verse>
    <verse num="44">And ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="45">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="46">Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop <i>thy word</i> toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;</verse>
    <verse num="47">And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.</verse>
    <verse num="48">And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.</verse>
    <verse num="49">Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop <i>thy word</i> toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,</verse>
    <verse num="3">And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:</verse>
    <verse num="5">That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of <i>thy</i> loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak <i>as</i> water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:</verse>
    <verse num="10">It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, <i>as</i> every tree.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it <i>shall be</i> upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon <i>thy</i> thigh.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Because <i>it is</i> a trial, and what if <i>the sword</i> contemn even the rod? it shall be no <i>more,</i> saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite <i>thine</i> hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it <i>is</i> the sword of the great <i>men that are</i> slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.</verse>
    <verse num="15">I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that <i>their</i> heart may faint, and <i>their</i> ruins be multiplied: ah! <i>it is</i> made bright, <i>it is</i> wrapped up for the slaughter.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Go thee one way or other, <i>either</i> on the right hand, <i>or</i> on the left, whithersoever thy face <i>is</i> set.</verse>
    <verse num="17">I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="18">The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="19">Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose <i>it</i> at the head of the way to the city.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.</verse>
    <verse num="21">For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made <i>his</i> arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.</verse>
    <verse num="22">At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint <i>battering</i> rams against the gates, to cast a mount, <i>and</i> to build a fort.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, <i>I say,</i> that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity <i>shall have</i> an end,</verse>
    <verse num="26">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> the same: exalt <i>him that is</i> low, and abase <i>him that is</i> high.</verse>
    <verse num="27">I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no <i>more,</i> until he come whose right it is; and I will give it <i>him.</i></verse>
    <verse num="28">And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword <i>is</i> drawn: for the slaughter <i>it is</i> furbished, to consume because of the glittering:</verse>
    <verse num="29">Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of <i>them that are</i> slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity <i>shall have</i> an end.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Shall I cause <i>it</i> to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, <i>and</i> skilful to destroy.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no <i>more</i> remembered: for I the LORD have spoken <i>it.</i></verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come <i>even</i> unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.</verse>
    <verse num="5"><i>Those that be</i> near, and <i>those that be</i> far from thee, shall mock thee, <i>which art</i> infamous <i>and</i> much vexed.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.</verse>
    <verse num="7">In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.</verse>
    <verse num="9">In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.</verse>
    <verse num="10">In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.</verse>
    <verse num="12">In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken <i>it,</i> and will do <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="15">And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="18">Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they <i>are</i> brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are <i>even</i> the dross of silver.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="20"><i>As</i> they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt <i>it;</i> so will I gather <i>you</i> in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave <i>you there,</i> and melt you.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="22">As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="24">Son of man, say unto her, Thou <i>art</i> the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.</verse>
    <verse num="25"><i>There is</i> a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed <i>difference</i> between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Her princes in the midst thereof <i>are</i> like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, <i>and</i> to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And her prophets have daubed them with untempered <i>morter,</i> seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.</verse>
    <verse num="29">The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="23">
    <verse num="1">The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the names of them <i>were</i> Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus <i>were</i> their names; Samaria <i>is</i> Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians <i>her</i> neighbours,</verse>
    <verse num="6"><i>Which were</i> clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them <i>that were</i> the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Neither left she her whoredoms <i>brought</i> from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</verse>
    <verse num="10">These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And when her sister Aholibah saw <i>this,</i> she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in <i>her</i> whoredoms.</verse>
    <verse num="12">She doted upon the Assyrians <i>her</i> neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then I saw that she was defiled, <i>that</i> they <i>took</i> both one way,</verse>
    <verse num="14">And <i>that</i> she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,</verse>
    <verse num="15">Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</verse>
    <verse num="16">And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="20">For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh <i>is as</i> the flesh of asses, and whose issue <i>is like</i> the issue of horses.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;</verse>
    <verse num="23">The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, <i>and</i> all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, <i>which</i> shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</verse>
    <verse num="26">They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom <i>brought</i> from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</verse>
    <verse num="28">For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand <i>of them</i> whom thou hatest, into the hand <i>of them</i> from whom thy mind is alienated:</verse>
    <verse num="29">And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</verse>
    <verse num="30">I will do these <i>things</i> unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, <i>and</i> because thou art polluted with their idols.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Thou shalt even drink it and suck <i>it</i> out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken <i>it,</i> saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</verse>
    <verse num="36">The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;</verse>
    <verse num="37">That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through <i>the fire,</i> to devour <i>them. </i></verse>
    <verse num="38">Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</verse>
    <verse num="39">For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.</verse>
    <verse num="40">And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger <i>was</i> sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,</verse>
    <verse num="41">And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.</verse>
    <verse num="42">And a voice of a multitude being at ease <i>was</i> with her: and with the men of the common sort <i>were</i> brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Then said I unto <i>her that was</i> old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she <i>with them? </i></verse>
    <verse num="44">Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.</verse>
    <verse num="45">And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they <i>are</i> adulteresses, and blood <i>is</i> in their hands.</verse>
    <verse num="46">For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</verse>
    <verse num="47">And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="48">Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</verse>
    <verse num="49">And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="24">
    <verse num="1">Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, write thee the name of the day, <i>even</i> of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set <i>it</i> on, and also pour water into it:</verse>
    <verse num="4">Gather the pieces thereof into it, <i>even</i> every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill <i>it</i> with the choice bones.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, <i>and</i> make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum <i>is</i> not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</verse>
    <verse num="8">That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and <i>that</i> the filthiness of it may be molten in it, <i>that</i> the scum of it may be consumed.</verse>
    <verse num="12">She hath wearied <i>herself</i> with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum <i>shall be</i> in the fire.</verse>
    <verse num="13">In thy filthiness <i>is</i> lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</verse>
    <verse num="14">I the LORD have spoken <i>it:</i> it shall come to pass, and I will do <i>it;</i> I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="16">Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not <i>thy</i> lips, and eat not the bread of men.</verse>
    <verse num="18">So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these <i>things are</i> to us, that thou doest <i>so? </i></verse>
    <verse num="20">Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="21">Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.</verse>

    <verse num="1">The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;</verse>

    <verse num="1">The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</verse>

  <chapter num="31">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third <i>month,</i> in the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?</verse>
    <verse num="3">Behold, the Assyrian <i>was</i> a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.</verse>
    <verse num="4">The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.</verse>
    <verse num="6">All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.</verse>
    <verse num="9">I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that <i>were</i> in the garden of God, envied him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;</verse>
    <verse num="11">I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:</verse>
    <verse num="14">To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.</verse>
    <verse num="16">I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="17">They also went down into hell with him unto <i>them that be</i> slain with the sword; and <i>they that were</i> his arm, <i>that</i> dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.</verse>
    <verse num="18">To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with <i>them that be</i> slain by the sword. This <i>is</i> Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>

  <chapter num="32">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou <i>art</i> as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.</verse>
    <verse num="6">I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, <i>even</i> to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.</verse>
    <verse num="8">All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at <i>every</i> moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.</verse>
    <verse num="12">By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="15">When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>

    <verse num="25">They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves <i>are</i> round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of <i>them that be</i> slain.</verse>

  <chapter num="33">
    <verse num="1">Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:</verse>
    <verse num="3">If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take <i>any</i> person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.</verse>
    <verse num="8">When I say unto the wicked, O wicked <i>man,</i> thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins <i>be</i> upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?</verse>
    <verse num="11">Say unto them, <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</verse>
    <verse num="12">Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his <i>righteousness</i> in the day that he sinneth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">When I shall say to the righteous, <i>that</i> he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;</verse>
    <verse num="15"><i>If</i> the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.</verse>
    <verse num="16">None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.</verse>
    <verse num="18">When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.</verse>
    <verse num="19">But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth <i>month,</i> in the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="24">Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we <i>are</i> many; the land is given us for inheritance.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?</verse>
    <verse num="26">Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour’s wife: and shall ye possess the land?</verse>
    <verse num="27">Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; <i>As</i> I live, surely they that <i>are</i> in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that <i>is</i> in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.</verse>
    <verse num="28">For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Then shall they know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, <i>but</i> their heart goeth after their covetousness.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And, lo, thou <i>art</i> unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="34">
    <verse num="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe <i>be</i> to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?</verse>
    <verse num="3">Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: <i>but</i> ye feed not the flock.</verse>
    <verse num="4">The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up <i>that which was</i> broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they were scattered, because <i>there is</i> no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.</verse>
    <verse num="6">My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek <i>after them.</i></verse>
    <verse num="7">Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;</verse>
    <verse num="8"><i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because <i>there was</i> no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;</verse>
    <verse num="9">Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;</verse>
    <verse num="10">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <i>am</i> against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, <i>even</i> I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.</verse>
    <verse num="12">As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep <i>that are</i> scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.</verse>
    <verse num="14">I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and <i>in</i> a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="15">I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="16">I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up <i>that which was</i> broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And <i>as for</i> you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.</verse>
    <verse num="18"><i>Seemeth it</i> a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?</verse>
    <verse num="19">And <i>as for</i> my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, <i>even</i> I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;</verse>
    <verse num="22">Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, <i>even</i> my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="25">And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God <i>am</i> with them, and <i>that</i> they, <i>even</i> the house of Israel, <i>are</i> my people, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="4">I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:</verse>

    <verse num="21">But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not <i>this</i> for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="24">For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.</verse>
    <verse num="26">A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do <i>them. </i></verse>
    <verse num="28">And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</verse>
    <verse num="29">I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that <i>were</i> not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Not for your sakes do I <i>this,</i> saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause <i>you</i> to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities <i>are become</i> fenced, <i>and</i> are inhabited.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined <i>places, and</i> plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken <i>it,</i> and I will do <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="37">Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet <i>for</i> this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do <i>it</i> for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.</verse>

    <verse num="1">The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which <i>was</i> full of bones,</verse>
    <verse num="2">And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, <i>there were</i> very many in the open valley; and, lo, <i>they were</i> very dry.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:</verse>
    <verse num="6">And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but <i>there was </i>no breath in them.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</verse>
    <verse num="10">So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,</verse>

    <verse num="19">Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which <i>is</i> in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, <i>even</i> with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</verse>
    <verse num="22">And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:</verse>
    <verse num="23">Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And David my servant <i>shall be</i> king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.</verse>

    <verse num="26">Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.</verse>

    <verse num="1">In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.</verse>

    <verse num="5">And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits <i>long</i> by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, <i>which was</i> the breadth of the tabernacle.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the breadth of the door <i>was</i> ten cubits; and the sides of the door <i>were</i> five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This <i>is</i> the most holy <i>place. </i></verse>
    <verse num="5">After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of <i>every</i> side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the side chambers <i>were</i> three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which <i>was</i> of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And <i>there was</i> an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house <i>was still</i> upward, and so increased <i>from</i> the lowest <i>chamber</i> to the highest by the midst.</verse>
    <verse num="8">I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers <i>were</i> a full reed of six great cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="9">The thickness of the wall, which <i>was</i> for the side chamber without, <i>was</i> five cubits: and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> left <i>was</i> the place of the side chambers that <i>were</i> within.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And between the chambers <i>was</i> the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the doors of the side chambers <i>were</i> toward <i>the place that was</i> left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left <i>was</i> five cubits round about.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now the building that <i>was</i> before the separate place at the end toward the west <i>was</i> seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building <i>was</i> five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;</verse>
    <verse num="14">Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which <i>was</i> behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;</verse>
    <verse num="16">The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows <i>were</i> covered;</verse>
    <verse num="17">To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And <i>it was</i> made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree <i>was</i> between a cherub and a cherub; and <i>every</i> cherub had two faces;</verse>
    <verse num="19">So that the face of a man <i>was</i> toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: <i>it was</i> made through all the house round about.</verse>
    <verse num="20">From the ground unto above the door <i>were</i> cherubims and palm trees made, and <i>on</i> the wall of the temple.</verse>
    <verse num="21">The posts of the temple <i>were</i> squared, <i>and</i> the face of the sanctuary; the appearance <i>of the one</i> as the appearance <i>of the other. </i></verse>
    <verse num="22">The altar of wood <i>was</i> three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, <i>were</i> of wood: and he said unto me, This <i>is</i> the table that <i>is</i> before the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the doors had two leaves <i>apiece,</i> two turning leaves; two <i>leaves</i> for the one door, and two leaves for the other <i>door. </i></verse>
    <verse num="25">And <i>there were</i> made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as <i>were</i> made upon the walls; and <i>there were</i> thick planks upon the face of the porch without.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And <i>there were</i> narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and <i>upon</i> the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.</verse>

  <chapter num="42">
    <verse num="1">Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that <i>was</i> over against the separate place, and which <i>was</i> before the building toward the north.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Before the length of an hundred cubits <i>was</i> the north door, and the breadth <i>was</i> fifty cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Over against the twenty <i>cubits</i> which <i>were</i> for the inner court, and over against the pavement which <i>was</i> for the utter court, <i>was</i> gallery against gallery in three <i>stories. </i></verse>
    <verse num="4">And before the chambers <i>was</i> a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now the upper chambers <i>were</i> shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For they <i>were</i> in three <i>stories,</i> but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore <i>the building</i> was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the wall that <i>was</i> without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof <i>was</i> fifty cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For the length of the chambers that <i>were</i> in the utter court <i>was</i> fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple <i>were</i> an hundred cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And from under these chambers <i>was</i> the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.</verse>
    <verse num="10">The chambers <i>were</i> in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the way before them <i>was</i> like the appearance of the chambers which <i>were</i> toward the north, as long as they, <i>and</i> as broad as they: and all their goings out <i>were</i> both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And according to the doors of the chambers that <i>were</i> toward the south <i>was</i> a door in the head of the way, <i>even</i> the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then said he unto me, The north chambers <i>and</i> the south chambers, which <i>are</i> before the separate place, they <i>be</i> holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place <i>is</i> holy.</verse>
    <verse num="14">When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy <i>place</i> into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they <i>are</i> holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to <i>those things</i> which <i>are</i> for the people.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the east, and measured it round about.</verse>
    <verse num="16">He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</verse>
    <verse num="17">He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</verse>
    <verse num="18">He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.</verse>
    <verse num="19">He turned about to the west side, <i>and</i> measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.</verse>
    <verse num="20">He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred <i>reeds</i> long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="43">
    <verse num="1">Afterward he brought me to the gate, <i>even</i> the gate that looketh toward the east:</verse>
    <verse num="2">And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice <i>was</i> like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And <i>it was</i> according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, <i>even</i> according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions <i>were</i> like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the east.</verse>
    <verse num="5">So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And I heard <i>him</i> speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, <i>neither</i> they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.</verse>
    <verse num="8">In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write <i>it</i> in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.</verse>
    <verse num="12">This <i>is</i> the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about <i>shall be</i> most holy. Behold, this <i>is</i> the law of the house.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And these <i>are</i> the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit <i>is</i> a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom <i>shall be</i> a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about <i>shall be</i> a span: and this <i>shall be</i> the higher place of the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And from the bottom <i>upon</i> the ground <i>even</i> to the lower settle <i>shall be</i> two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle <i>even</i> to the greater settle <i>shall be</i> four cubits, and the breadth <i>one</i> cubit.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So the altar <i>shall be</i> four cubits; and from the altar and upward <i>shall be</i> four horns.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the altar <i>shall be</i> twelve <i>cubits</i> long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the settle <i>shall be</i> fourteen <i>cubits</i> long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it <i>shall be</i> half a cubit; and the bottom thereof <i>shall be</i> a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These <i>are</i> the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put <i>it</i> on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse <i>it</i> with the bullock.</verse>
    <verse num="23">When thou hast made an end of cleansing <i>it,</i> thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up <i>for</i> a burnt offering unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat <i>for</i> a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And when these days are expired, it shall be, <i>that</i> upon the eighth day, and <i>so</i> forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>

  <chapter num="44">
    <verse num="1">Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it <i>was</i> shut.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</verse>
    <verse num="3"><i>It is</i> for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of <i>that</i> gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And thou shalt say to the rebellious, <i>even</i> to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,</verse>

    <verse num="8">And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that <i>is</i> among the children of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, <i>having</i> charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy <i>place:</i> but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:</verse>
    <verse num="16">They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.</verse>

    <verse num="19">And when they go forth into the utter court, <i>even</i> into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.</verse>

    <verse num="26">And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length <i>shall be</i> the length of five and twenty thousand <i>reeds,</i> and the breadth <i>shall be</i> ten thousand.

    <verse num="15">Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning <i>for</i> a continual burnt offering.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons’; it <i>shall be</i> their possession by inheritance.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; <i>but</i> he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.</verse>
    <verse num="19">After he brought me through the entry, which <i>was</i> at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there <i>was</i> a place on the two sides westward.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear <i>them</i> not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court <i>there was</i> a court.</verse>
    <verse num="22">In the four corners of the court <i>there were</i> courts joined of forty <i>cubits</i> long and thirty broad: these four corners <i>were</i> of one measure.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And <i>there was</i> a row <i>of building</i> round about in them, round about them four, and <i>it was</i> made with boiling places under the rows round about.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then said he unto me, These <i>are</i> the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.</verse>

  <chapter num="47">
    <verse num="1">Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house <i>stood toward</i> the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south <i>side</i> of the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters <i>were</i> to the ancles.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters <i>were</i> to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters <i>were</i> to the loins.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Afterward he measured a thousand; <i>and it was</i> a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen <i>this?</i> Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river <i>were</i> very many trees on the one side and on the other.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: <i>which being</i> brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a <i>place</i> to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Thus saith the Lord GOD; This <i>shall be</i> the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph <i>shall have two</i> portions.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: <i>concerning</i> the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And this <i>shall be</i> the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;</verse>
    <verse num="16">Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which <i>is</i> between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And <i>this is</i> the north side.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And <i>this is</i> the east side.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the south side southward, from Tamar <i>even</i> to the waters of strife <i>in</i> Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And <i>this is</i> the south side southward.</verse>
    <verse num="20">The west side also <i>shall be</i> the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This <i>is</i> the west side.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give <i>him</i> his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
