  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness <i>was</i> upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And God saw the light, that <i>it was</i> good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which <i>were</i> under the firmament from the waters which <i>were</i> above the firmament: and it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry <i>land</i> appear: and it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And God called the dry <i>land</i> Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, <i>and</i> the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed <i>is</i> in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the earth brought forth grass, <i>and</i> herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed <i>was</i> in itself, after his kind: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the evening and the morning were the third day.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: <i>he made</i> the stars also.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</verse>
    <verse num="18">And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl <i>that</i> may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="27">So God created man in his <i>own</i> image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which <i>is</i> upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which <i>is</i> the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein <i>there is</i> life, <i>I have given</i> every green herb for meat: and it was so.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <i>it was</i> very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</verse>
    <verse num="4">These <i>are</i> the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</verse>
    <verse num="5">And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and <i>there was</i> not a man to till the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the LORD God formed man <i>of</i> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The name of the first <i>is</i> Pison: that <i>is</i> it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where <i>there is</i> gold;</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the gold of that land <i>is</i> good: there <i>is</i> bdellium and the onyx stone.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the name of the second river <i>is</i> Gihon: the same <i>is</i> it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the name of the third river <i>is</i> Hiddekel: that <i>is</i> it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river <i>is</i> Euphrates.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</verse>
    <verse num="17">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the LORD God said, <i>It is</i> not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought <i>them</i> unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that <i>was</i> the name thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Adam said, This <i>is</i> now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</verse>
    <verse num="3">But of the fruit of the tree which <i>is</i> in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</verse>
    <verse num="5">For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And when the woman saw that the tree <i>was</i> good for food, and that it <i>was</i> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make <i>one</i> wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they <i>were</i> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where <i>art</i> thou?</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I <i>was</i> naked; and I hid myself.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he said, Who told thee that thou <i>wast</i> naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest <i>to be</i> with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the LORD God said unto the woman, What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou <i>art</i> cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire <i>shall be</i> to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed <i>is</i> the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat <i>of</i> it all the days of thy life;</verse>
    <verse num="18">Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</verse>
    <verse num="19">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou <i>art,</i> and unto dust shalt thou return.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</verse>
    <verse num="23">Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</verse>
    <verse num="24">So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</verse>
    <verse num="5">But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</verse>
    <verse num="7">If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee <i>shall be</i> his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the LORD said unto Cain, Where <i>is</i> Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: <i>Am</i> I my brother’s keeper?</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And now <i>art</i> thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;</verse>
    <verse num="12">When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment <i>is</i> greater than I can bear.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> every one that findeth me shall slay me.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one <i>was</i> Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and <i>of such as have</i> cattle.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And his brother’s name <i>was</i> Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Zillah, she also bare Tubal- cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain <i>was</i> Naamah.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</verse>
    <verse num="24">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, <i>said she,</i> hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">This <i>is</i> the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;</verse>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,</verse>
    <verse num="2">That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they <i>were</i> fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also <i>is</i> flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.</verse>
    <verse num="4">There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare <i>children</i> to them, the same <i>became</i> mighty men which <i>were</i> of old, men of renown.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And GOD saw that the wickedness of man <i>was</i> great in the earth, and <i>that</i> every imagination of the thoughts of his heart <i>was</i> only evil continually.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">These <i>are</i> the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man <i>and</i> perfect in his generations, <i>and</i> Noah walked with God.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</verse>
    <verse num="11">The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And this <i>is the fashion</i> which thou shalt make it <i>of:</i> The length of the ark <i>shall be</i> three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.</verse>
    <verse num="16">A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; <i>with</i> lower, second, and third <i>stories</i> shalt thou make it.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein <i>is</i> the breath of life, from under heaven; <i>and</i> every thing that <i>is</i> in the earth shall die.</verse>
    <verse num="18">But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every <i>sort</i> shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep <i>them</i> alive with thee; they shall be male and female.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every <i>sort</i> shall come unto thee, to keep <i>them</i> alive.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather <i>it</i> to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that <i>are</i> not clean by two, the male and his female.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Noah <i>was</i> six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Of clean beasts, and of beasts that <i>are</i> not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,</verse>
    <verse num="9">There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="11">In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.</verse>
    <verse num="13">In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;</verse>
    <verse num="14">They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein <i>is</i> the breath of life.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that <i>were</i> under the whole heaven, were covered.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:</verse>
    <verse num="22">All in whose nostrils <i>was</i> the breath of life, of all that <i>was</i> in the dry <i>land,</i> died.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained <i>alive,</i> and they that <i>were</i> with him in the ark.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1">And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that <i>was</i> with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;</verse>
    <verse num="2">The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth <i>month,</i> on the first <i>day</i> of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;</verse>
    <verse num="9">But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters <i>were</i> on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth <i>was</i> an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first <i>month,</i> the first <i>day</i> of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And God spake unto Noah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="16">Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Bring forth with thee every living thing that <i>is</i> with thee, of all flesh, <i>both</i> of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:</verse>
    <verse num="19">Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, <i>and</i> whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart <i>is</i> evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</verse>
    <verse num="22">While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth <i>upon</i> the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But flesh with the life thereof, <i>which is</i> the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;</verse>
    <verse num="10">And with every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And God said, This <i>is</i> the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, for perpetual generations:</verse>
    <verse num="13">I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And I will remember my covenant, which <i>is</i> between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that <i>is</i> upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And God said unto Noah, This <i>is</i> the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that <i>is</i> upon the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="19">These <i>are</i> the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Noah began <i>to be</i> an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:</verse>
    <verse num="21">And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid <i>it</i> upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces <i>were</i> backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And he said, Cursed <i>be</i> Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And he said, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</verse>
    <verse num="27">God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">Now these <i>are</i> the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.</verse>
    <verse num="5">By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same <i>is</i> a great city.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.</verse>
    <verse num="20">These <i>are</i> the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, <i>and</i> in their nations.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were <i>children</i> born.</verse>
    <verse num="22">The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one <i>was</i> Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name <i>was</i> Joktan.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazar-maveth, and Jerah,</verse>

    <verse num="28">And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these <i>were</i> the sons of Joktan.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.</verse>
    <verse num="31">These <i>are</i> the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</verse>
    <verse num="32">These <i>are</i> the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top <i>may reach</i> unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the LORD said, Behold, the people <i>is</i> one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.</verse>
    <verse num="8">So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="10">These <i>are</i> the generations of Shem: Shem <i>was</i> an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Now these <i>are</i> the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife <i>was</i> Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</verse>
    <verse num="30">But Sarai was barren; she <i>had</i> no child.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee:</verse>
    <verse num="2">And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram <i>was</i> seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite <i>was</i> then in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, <i>having</i> Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine <i>was</i> grievous in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou <i>art</i> a fair woman to look upon:</verse>
    <verse num="12">Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This <i>is</i> his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Say, I pray thee, thou <i>art</i> my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she <i>was</i> very fair.</verse>
    <verse num="15">The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she <i>was</i> thy wife?</verse>
    <verse num="19">Why saidst thou, She <i>is</i> my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take <i>her,</i> and go thy way.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Pharaoh commanded <i>his</i> men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="13">
    <verse num="1">And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Abram <i>was</i> very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;</verse>
    <verse num="4">Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we <i>be</i> brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="9"><i>Is</i> not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if <i>thou wilt take</i> the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if <i>thou depart</i> to the right hand, then I will go to the left.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it <i>was</i> well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, <i>even</i> as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched <i>his</i> tent toward Sodom.</verse>
    <verse num="13">But the men of Sodom <i>were</i> wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:</verse>
    <verse num="15">For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, <i>then</i> shall thy seed also be numbered.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Abram removed <i>his</i> tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which <i>is</i> in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.</verse>

    <verse num="4">And, behold, the word of the LORD <i>came</i> unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he said unto him, I <i>am</i> the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land <i>that is</i> not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</verse>
    <verse num="14">And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</verse>
    <verse num="16">But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites <i>is</i> not yet full.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</verse>
    <verse num="18">In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:</verse>
    <verse num="19">The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,</verse>

  <chapter num="16">
    <verse num="1">Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name <i>was</i> Hagar.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong <i>be</i> upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid <i>is</i> in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou <i>art</i> with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he will be a wild man; his hand <i>will be</i> against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</verse>
    <verse num="14">Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, <i>it is</i> between Kadesh and Bered.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Abram <i>was</i> fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="17">
    <verse num="1">And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I <i>am</i> the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="4">As for me, behold, my covenant <i>is</i> with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.</verse>
    <verse num="10">This <i>is</i> my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which <i>is</i> not of thy seed.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah <i>shall</i> her name <i>be. </i></verse>
    <verse num="16">And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be <i>a mother</i> of nations; kings of people shall be of her.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall <i>a child</i> be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!</verse>
    <verse num="19">And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, <i>and</i> with his seed after him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.</verse>
    <verse num="21">But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Abraham <i>was</i> ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Ishmael his son <i>was</i> thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</verse>
    <verse num="26">In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.</verse>

  </chapter>
  <chapter num="18">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw <i>them,</i> he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</verse>
    <verse num="3">And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</verse>
    <verse num="4">Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</verse>
    <verse num="5">And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead <i>it,</i> and make cakes upon the hearth.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave <i>it</i> unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set <i>it</i> before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they said unto him, Where <i>is</i> Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard <i>it</i> in the tent door, which <i>was</i> behind him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Now Abraham and Sarah <i>were</i> old <i>and</i> well stricken in age; <i>and</i> it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</verse>
    <verse num="14">Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</verse>
    <verse num="18">Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</verse>
    <verse num="19">For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</verse>
    <verse num="21">I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</verse>
    <verse num="24">Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that <i>are</i> therein?</verse>
    <verse num="25">That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</verse>
    <verse num="26">And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which <i>am but</i> dust and ashes:</verse>
    <verse num="28">Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for <i>lack of</i> five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="29">And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do <i>it</i> for forty’s sake.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And he said <i>unto him,</i> Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do <i>it,</i> if I find thirty there.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy <i>it</i> for twenty’s sake.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy <i>it</i> for ten’s sake.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</verse>

  <chapter num="19">
    <verse num="1">And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing <i>them</i> rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But before they lay down, the men of the city, <i>even</i> the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where <i>are</i> the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,</verse>
    <verse num="7">And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as <i>is</i> good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they said, Stand back. And they said <i>again,</i> This one <i>fellow</i> came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, <i>even</i> Lot, and came near to break the door.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And they smote the men that <i>were</i> at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring <i>them</i> out of this place:</verse>
    <verse num="13">For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:</verse>
    <verse num="19">Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:</verse>
    <verse num="20">Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (<i>is</i> it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</verse>
    <verse num="23">The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;</verse>

    <verse num="27">And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:</verse>
    <verse num="28">And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father <i>is</i> old, and <i>there is</i> not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:</verse>
    <verse num="32">Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, <i>and</i> lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same <i>is</i> the father of the Moabites unto this day.</verse>

  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She <i>is</i> my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</verse>
    <verse num="3">But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou <i>art but</i> a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she <i>is</i> a man’s wife.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?</verse>
    <verse num="5">Said he not unto me, She <i>is</i> my sister? and she, even she herself said, He <i>is</i> my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Now therefore restore the man <i>his</i> wife; for he <i>is</i> a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore <i>her</i> not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that <i>are</i> thine.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God <i>is</i> not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And yet indeed <i>she is</i> my sister; she <i>is</i> the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This <i>is</i> thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He <i>is</i> my brother.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave <i>them</i> unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Abimelech said, Behold, my land <i>is</i> before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver: behold, he <i>is</i> to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that <i>are</i> with thee, and with all <i>other:</i> thus she was reproved.</verse>
    <verse num="17">So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare <i>children. </i></verse>
    <verse num="18">For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.</verse>

    <verse num="3">And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, <i>so that</i> all that hear will laugh with me.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born <i>him</i> a son in his old age.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the <i>same</i> day that Isaac was weaned.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, <i>even</i> with Isaac.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he <i>is</i> thy seed.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave <i>it</i> unto Hagar, putting <i>it</i> on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And she went, and sat her down over against <i>him</i> a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against <i>him,</i> and lift up her voice, and wept.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he <i>is. </i></verse>
    <verse num="18">Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God <i>is</i> with thee in all that thou doest:</verse>
    <verse num="23">Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: <i>but</i> according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Abraham said, I will swear.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I <i>of it,</i> but to day.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What <i>mean</i> these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?</verse>
    <verse num="30">And he said, For <i>these</i> seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And <i>Abraham</i> planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, <i>here</i> I <i>am. </i></verse>
    <verse num="2">And he said, Take now thy son, thine only <i>son</i> Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you,</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid <i>it</i> upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here <i>am</i> I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where <i>is</i> the lamb for a burnt offering?</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here <i>am</i> I.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only <i>son</i> from me.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind <i>him</i> a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said <i>to</i> this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,</verse>
    <verse num="16">And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only <i>son: </i></verse>
    <verse num="17">That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which <i>is</i> upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</verse>
    <verse num="18">And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</verse>
    <verse num="19">So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;</verse>
    <verse num="21">Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And his concubine, whose name <i>was</i> Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="23">
    <verse num="1">And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: <i>these were</i> the years of the life of Sarah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same <i>is</i> Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="4">I <i>am</i> a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,</verse>
    <verse num="6">Hear us, my lord: thou <i>art</i> a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, <i>even</i> to the children of Heth.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</verse>
    <verse num="9">That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which <i>is</i> in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, <i>even</i> of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="11">Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that <i>is</i> therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou <i>wilt give it,</i> I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take <i>it</i> of me, and I will bury my dead there.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,</verse>
    <verse num="15">My lord, hearken unto me: the land <i>is worth</i> four hundred shekels of silver; what <i>is</i> that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current <i>money</i> with the merchant.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the field of Ephron, which <i>was</i> in Machpelah, which <i>was</i> before Mamre, the field, and the cave which <i>was</i> therein, and all the trees that <i>were</i> in the field, that <i>were</i> in all the borders round about, were made sure</verse>
    <verse num="18">Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same <i>is</i> Hebron in the land of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the field, and the cave that <i>is</i> therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="24">
    <verse num="1">And Abraham was old, <i>and</i> well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:</verse>
    <verse num="4">But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master <i>were</i> in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, <i>even</i> the time that women go out to draw <i>water. </i></verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Behold, I stand <i>here</i> by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:</verse>
    <verse num="14">And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: <i>let the same be</i> she <i>that</i> thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the damsel <i>was</i> very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw <i>water</i> for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw <i>water,</i> and drew for all his camels.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten <i>shekels</i> weight of gold;</verse>
    <verse num="23">And said, Whose daughter <i>art</i> thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room <i>in</i> thy father’s house for us to lodge in?</verse>
    <verse num="24">And she said unto him, I <i>am</i> the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.</verse>
    <verse num="25">She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And he said, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I <i>being</i> in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And the damsel ran, and told <i>them of</i> her mother’s house these things.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Rebekah had a brother, and his name <i>was</i> Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that <i>were</i> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And there was set <i>meat</i> before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And he said, I <i>am</i> Abraham’s servant.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:</verse>
    <verse num="38">But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.</verse>
    <verse num="40">And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:</verse>
    <verse num="41">Then shalt thou be clear from <i>this</i> my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee <i>one,</i> thou shalt be clear from my oath.</verse>
    <verse num="42">And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;</verse>
    <verse num="43">Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw <i>water,</i> and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;</verse>
    <verse num="44">And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: <i>let</i> the same <i>be</i> the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s son.</verse>
    <verse num="45">And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew <i>water:</i> and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.</verse>
    <verse num="46">And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her <i>shoulder,</i> and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.</verse>
    <verse num="47">And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter <i>art</i> thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.</verse>
    <verse num="48">And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.</verse>
    <verse num="49">And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.</verse>
    <verse num="50">Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</verse>
    <verse num="51">Behold, Rebekah <i>is</i> before thee, take <i>her,</i> and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.</verse>
    <verse num="52">And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, <i>bowing himself</i> to the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="53">And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave <i>them</i> to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.</verse>
    <verse num="54">And they did eat and drink, he and the men that <i>were</i> with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.</verse>
    <verse num="55">And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us <i>a few</i> days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.</verse>
    <verse num="56">And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</verse>
    <verse num="57">And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="58">And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.</verse>
    <verse num="59">And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.</verse>
    <verse num="60">And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou <i>art</i> our sister, be thou <i>the mother</i> of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.</verse>
    <verse num="61">And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.</verse>
    <verse num="62">And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.</verse>
    <verse num="63">And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels <i>were</i> coming.</verse>
    <verse num="64">And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.</verse>
    <verse num="65">For she <i>had</i> said unto the servant, What man <i>is</i> this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant <i>had</i> said, It <i>is</i> my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.</verse>
    <verse num="66">And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</verse>
    <verse num="67">And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s <i>death.</i></verse>

  <chapter num="25">
    <verse num="1">Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name <i>was</i> Keturah.</verse>

    <verse num="4">And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these <i>were</i> the children of Keturah.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And these <i>are</i> the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</verse>

    <verse num="8">And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac <i>was</i> sporting with Rebekah his wife.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she <i>is</i> thy wife: and how saidst thou, She <i>is</i> my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Abimelech said, What <i>is</i> this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Abimelech charged all <i>his</i> people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</verse>
    <verse num="14">For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water <i>is</i> ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I <i>am</i> the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I <i>am</i> with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?</verse>
    <verse num="28">And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, <i>even</i> betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</verse>
    <verse num="29">That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou <i>art</i> now the blessed of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city <i>is</i> Beer-sheba unto this day.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</verse>
    <verse num="35">Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="27">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, <i>here am</i> I.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:</verse>
    <verse num="3">Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me <i>some</i> venison;</verse>
    <verse num="4">And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring <i>it</i> to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt <i>for</i> venison, <i>and</i> to bring <i>it.</i></verse>
    <verse num="6">And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="7">Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:</verse>
    <verse num="10">And thou shalt bring <i>it</i> to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother <i>is</i> a hairy man, and I <i>am</i> a smooth man:</verse>
    <verse num="12">My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And his mother said unto him, Upon me <i>be</i> thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me <i>them. </i></verse>
    <verse num="14">And he went, and fetched, and brought <i>them</i> to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which <i>were</i> with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:</verse>
    <verse num="16">And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:</verse>
    <verse num="17">And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here <i>am</i> I; who <i>art</i> thou, my son?</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Jacob said unto his father, I <i>am</i> Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Isaac said unto his son, How <i>is it</i> that thou hast found <i>it</i> so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought <i>it</i> to me.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou <i>be</i> my very son Esau or not.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice <i>is</i> Jacob’s voice, but the hands <i>are</i> the hands of Esau.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And he said, <i>Art</i> thou my very son Esau? And he said, I <i>am. </i></verse>
    <verse num="25">And he said, Bring <i>it</i> near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought <i>it</i> near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son <i>is</i> as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:</verse>
    <verse num="28">Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:</verse>
    <verse num="29">Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed <i>be</i> every one that curseth thee, and blessed <i>be</i> he that blesseth thee.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And Isaac his father said unto him, Who <i>art</i> thou? And he said, I <i>am</i> thy son, thy firstborn Esau.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where <i>is</i> he that hath taken venison, and brought <i>it</i> me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, <i>and</i> he shall be blessed.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, <i>even</i> me also, O my father.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?</verse>
    <verse num="37">And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?</verse>
    <verse num="38">And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, <i>even</i> me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;</verse>
    <verse num="40">And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="42">And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, <i>purposing</i> to kill thee.</verse>
    <verse num="43">Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;</verse>
    <verse num="44">And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;</verse>
    <verse num="45">Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget <i>that</i> which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?</verse>
    <verse num="46">And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these <i>which are</i> of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="28">
    <verse num="1">And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;</verse>
    <verse num="4">And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.</verse>
    <verse num="6">When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;</verse>
    <verse num="7">And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and <i>put</i> them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I <i>am</i> the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;</verse>
    <verse num="14">And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And, behold, I <i>am</i> with thee, and will keep thee in all <i>places</i> whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done <i>that</i> which I have spoken to thee of.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew <i>it</i> not.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful <i>is</i> this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this <i>is</i> the gate of heaven.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put <i>for</i> his pillows, and set it up <i>for</i> a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city <i>was called</i> Luz at the first.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,</verse>
    <verse num="21">So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:</verse>

    <verse num="1">Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there <i>were</i> three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone <i>was</i> upon the well’s mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence <i>be</i> ye? And they said, Of Haran <i>are</i> we.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know <i>him. </i></verse>
    <verse num="6">And he said unto them, <i>Is</i> he well? And they said, <i>He is</i> well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he said, Lo, <i>it is</i> yet high day, neither <i>is it</i> time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go <i>and</i> feed <i>them. </i></verse>
    <verse num="8">And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and <i>till</i> they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep: for she kept them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Jacob told Rachel that he <i>was</i> her father’s brother, and that he <i>was</i> Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Laban said to him, Surely thou <i>art</i> my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou <i>art</i> my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what <i>shall</i> thy wages <i>be? </i></verse>
    <verse num="16">And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder <i>was</i> Leah, and the name of the younger <i>was</i> Rachel.</verse>

    <verse num="18">And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</verse>

    <verse num="22">And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid <i>for</i> an handmaid.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it <i>was</i> Leah: and he said to Laban, What <i>is</i> this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.</verse>

    <verse num="42">But when the cattle were feeble, he put <i>them</i> not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.</verse>
    <verse num="43">And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.</verse>

  <chapter num="31">
    <verse num="1">And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that <i>was</i> our father’s; and of <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it <i>was</i> not toward him as before.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,</verse>
    <verse num="5">And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it <i>is</i> not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.</verse>
    <verse num="8">If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given <i>them</i> to me.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle <i>were</i> ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, <i>saying,</i> Jacob: And I said, Here <i>am</i> I.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle <i>are</i> ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="13">I <i>am</i> the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, <i>and</i> where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, <i>Is there</i> yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?</verse>
    <verse num="15">Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that <i>is</i> ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;</verse>
    <verse num="18">And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that <i>were</i> her father’s.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face <i>toward</i> the mount Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives <i>taken</i> with the sword?</verse>
    <verse num="27">Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</verse>
    <verse num="28">And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.</verse>
    <verse num="29">It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And now, <i>though</i> thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, <i>yet</i> wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?</verse>
    <verse num="31">And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.</verse>
    <verse num="32">With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what <i>is</i> thine with me, and take <i>it</i> to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found <i>them</i> not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found <i>them</i> not.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What <i>is</i> my trespass? what <i>is</i> my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?</verse>
    <verse num="37">Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set <i>it</i> here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.</verse>
    <verse num="38">This twenty years <i>have</i> I <i>been</i> with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.</verse>
    <verse num="39">That which was torn <i>of beasts</i> I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, <i>whether</i> stolen by day, or stolen by night.</verse>
    <verse num="40"><i>Thus</i> I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="41">Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</verse>
    <verse num="42">Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked <i>thee</i> yesternight.</verse>
    <verse num="43">And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, <i>These</i> daughters <i>are</i> my daughters, and <i>these</i> children <i>are</i> my children, and <i>these</i> cattle <i>are</i> my cattle, and all that thou seest <i>is</i> mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?</verse>
    <verse num="44">Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</verse>
    <verse num="45">And Jacob took a stone, and set it up <i>for</i> a pillar.</verse>
    <verse num="46">And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.</verse>
    <verse num="47">And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</verse>
    <verse num="48">And Laban said, This heap <i>is</i> a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;</verse>
    <verse num="49">And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.</verse>
    <verse num="50">If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take <i>other</i> wives beside my daughters, no man <i>is</i> with us; see, God <i>is</i> witness betwixt me and thee.</verse>
    <verse num="51">And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold <i>this</i> pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;</verse>
    <verse num="52">This heap <i>be</i> witness, and <i>this</i> pillar <i>be</i> witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.</verse>
    <verse num="53">The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.</verse>
    <verse num="54">Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.</verse>
    <verse num="55">And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="32">
    <verse num="1">And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And when Jacob saw them, he said, This <i>is</i> God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:</verse>
    <verse num="5">And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that <i>was</i> with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;</verse>
    <verse num="8">And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</verse>
    <verse num="10">I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, <i>and</i> the mother with the children.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</verse>
    <verse num="14">Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</verse>
    <verse num="15">Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he delivered <i>them</i> into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose <i>art</i> thou? and whither goest thou? and whose <i>are</i> these before thee?</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then thou shalt say, <i>They be</i> thy servant Jacob’s; it <i>is</i> a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he <i>is</i> behind us.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob <i>is</i> behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And he said unto him, What <i>is</i> thy name? And he said, Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Jacob asked <i>him,</i> and said, Tell <i>me,</i> I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Therefore the children of Israel eat not <i>of</i> the sinew which shrank, which <i>is</i> upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="33">
    <verse num="1">And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who <i>are</i> those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And he said, What <i>meanest</i> thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, <i>These are</i> to find grace in the sight of my lord.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children <i>are</i> tender, and the flocks and herds with young <i>are</i> with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee <i>some</i> of the folk that <i>are</i> with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.</verse>
    <verse num="16">So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred pieces of money.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="34">
    <verse num="1">And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard <i>it:</i> and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And make ye marriages with us, <i>and</i> give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that <i>were</i> a reproach unto us:</verse>
    <verse num="15">But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we <i>be,</i> that every male of you be circumcised;</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he <i>was</i> more honourable than all the house of his father.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="21">These men <i>are</i> peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, <i>it is</i> large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they <i>are</i> circumcised.</verse>
    <verse num="23"><i>Shall</i> not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs <i>be</i> ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.</verse>
    <verse num="27">The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.</verse>
    <verse num="28">They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which <i>was</i> in the city, and that which <i>was</i> in the field,</verse>
    <verse num="29">And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that <i>was</i> in the house.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I <i>being</i> few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="35">
    <verse num="1">And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that <i>were</i> with him, Put away the strange gods that <i>are</i> among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which <i>were</i> in their hand, and <i>all their</i> earrings which <i>were</i> in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which <i>was</i> by Shechem.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that <i>were</i> round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</verse>
    <verse num="6">So Jacob came to Luz, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, that <i>is,</i> Bethel, he and all the people that <i>were</i> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</verse>

    <verse num="10">And God said unto him, Thy name <i>is</i> Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And God said unto him, I <i>am</i> God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</verse>
    <verse num="12">And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, <i>even</i> a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</verse>

    <verse num="16">And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.</verse>

    <verse num="7">For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.</verse>

  <chapter num="37">
    <verse num="1">And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="2">These <i>are</i> the generations of Jacob. Joseph, <i>being</i> seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad <i>was</i> with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he <i>was</i> the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of <i>many</i> colours.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told <i>it</i> his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</verse>
    <verse num="7">For, behold, we <i>were</i> binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he told <i>it</i> to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What <i>is</i> this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</verse>
    <verse num="11">And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed <i>the flock</i> in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here <i>am</i> I.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And a certain man found him, and, behold, <i>he was</i> wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed <i>their flocks. </i></verse>
    <verse num="17">And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Reuben heard <i>it,</i> and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, <i>but</i> cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, <i>his</i> coat of <i>many</i> colours that <i>was</i> on him;</verse>
    <verse num="24">And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit <i>was</i> empty, <i>there was</i> no water in it.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry <i>it</i> down to Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit <i>is it</i> if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</verse>
    <verse num="27">Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he <i>is</i> our brother <i>and</i> our flesh. And his brethren were content.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty <i>pieces</i> of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph <i>was</i> not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child <i>is</i> not; and I, whither shall I go?</verse>
    <verse num="31">And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;</verse>
    <verse num="32">And they sent the coat of <i>many</i> colours, and they brought <i>it</i> to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it <i>be</i> thy son’s coat or no.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And he knew it, and said, <i>It is</i> my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, <i>and</i> captain of the guard.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="38">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name <i>was</i> Hirah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name <i>was</i> Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name <i>was</i> Tamar.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled <i>it</i> on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren <i>did.</i> And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which <i>is</i> by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.</verse>
    <verse num="15">When Judah saw her, he thought her <i>to be</i> an harlot; because she had covered her face.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she <i>was</i> his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he said, I will send <i>thee</i> a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give <i>me</i> a pledge, till thou send <i>it? </i></verse>
    <verse num="18">And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that <i>is</i> in thine hand. And he gave <i>it</i> her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive <i>his</i> pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where <i>is</i> the harlot, that <i>was</i> openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this <i>place. </i></verse>
    <verse num="22">And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, <i>that</i> there was no harlot in this <i>place. </i></verse>
    <verse num="23">And Judah said, Let her take <i>it</i> to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she <i>is</i> with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</verse>
    <verse num="25">When she <i>was</i> brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these <i>are, am</i> I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose <i>are</i> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Judah acknowledged <i>them,</i> and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins <i>were</i> in her womb.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And it came to pass, when she travailed, that <i>the one</i> put out <i>his</i> hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first,</verse>
    <verse num="29">And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? <i>this</i> breach <i>be</i> upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="39">
    <verse num="1">And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And his master saw that the LORD <i>was</i> with him, and that the LORD made all <i>that</i> he did to prosper in his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And it came to pass from the time <i>that</i> he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was <i>a</i> goodly <i>person,</i> and well favoured.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what <i>is</i> with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;</verse>
    <verse num="9"><i>There is</i> none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou <i>art</i> his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</verse>
    <verse num="10">And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, <i>or</i> to be with her.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And it came to pass about this time, that <i>Joseph</i> went into the house to do his business; and <i>there was</i> none of the men of the house there within.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,</verse>
    <verse num="14">That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:</verse>
    <verse num="18">And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners <i>were</i> bound: and he was there in the prison.</verse>
    <verse num="21">But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that <i>were</i> in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer <i>of it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="23">The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing <i>that was</i> under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and <i>that</i> which he did, the LORD made <i>it</i> to prosper.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="40">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass after these things, <i>that</i> the butler of the king of Egypt and <i>his</i> baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Pharaoh was wroth against two <i>of</i> his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph <i>was</i> bound.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which <i>were</i> bound in the prison.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they <i>were</i> sad.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that <i>were</i> with him in the ward of his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye <i>so</i> sadly to day?</verse>
    <verse num="8">And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and <i>there is</i> no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, <i>Do</i> not interpretations <i>belong</i> to God? tell me <i>them,</i> I pray you.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine <i>was</i> before me;</verse>
    <verse num="10">And in the vine <i>were</i> three branches: and it <i>was</i> as though it budded, <i>and</i> her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Pharaoh’s cup <i>was</i> in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Joseph said unto him, This <i>is</i> the interpretation of it: The three branches <i>are</i> three days:</verse>
    <verse num="13">Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.</verse>
    <verse num="14">But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:</verse>
    <verse num="15">For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.</verse>
    <verse num="16">When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also <i>was</i> in my dream, and, behold, <i>I had</i> three white baskets on my head:</verse>
    <verse num="17">And in the uppermost basket <i>there was</i> of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Joseph answered and said, This <i>is</i> the interpretation thereof: The three baskets <i>are</i> three days:</verse>
    <verse num="19">Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And it came to pass the third day, <i>which was</i> Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:</verse>
    <verse num="22">But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="41">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the <i>other</i> kine upon the brink of the river.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, <i>it was</i> a dream.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but <i>there was</i> none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</verse>
    <verse num="10">Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, both <i>me</i> and the chief baker:</verse>
    <verse num="11">And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And <i>there was</i> there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved <i>himself,</i> and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and <i>there is</i> none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, <i>that</i> thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, <i>It is</i> not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</verse>
    <verse num="18">And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</verse>
    <verse num="19">And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</verse>
    <verse num="20">And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:</verse>
    <verse num="21">And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they <i>were</i> still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:</verse>
    <verse num="23">And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <i>and</i> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told <i>this</i> unto the magicians; but <i>there was</i> none that could declare <i>it</i> to me.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh <i>is</i> one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he <i>is</i> about to do.</verse>
    <verse num="26">The seven good kine <i>are</i> seven years; and the seven good ears <i>are</i> seven years: the dream <i>is</i> one.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them <i>are</i> seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</verse>
    <verse num="28">This <i>is</i> the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God <i>is</i> about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:</verse>
    <verse num="30">And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</verse>
    <verse num="31">And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it <i>shall be</i> very grievous.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; <i>it is</i> because the thing <i>is</i> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Let Pharaoh do <i>this,</i> and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</verse>
    <verse num="38">And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find <i>such a one</i> as this <i>is,</i> a man in whom the Spirit of God is?</verse>
    <verse num="39">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, <i>there is</i> none so discreet and wise as thou <i>art: </i></verse>
    <verse num="40">Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</verse>
    <verse num="41">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="42">And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</verse>
    <verse num="43">And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him <i>ruler</i> over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="44">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I <i>am</i> Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="45">And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over <i>all</i> the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="46">And Joseph <i>was</i> thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="47">And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</verse>
    <verse num="48">And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which <i>was</i> round about every city, laid he up in the same.</verse>
    <verse num="49">And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for <i>it was</i> without number.</verse>
    <verse num="50">And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On bare unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="51">And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, <i>said he,</i> hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.</verse>
    <verse num="52">And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</verse>
    <verse num="53">And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.</verse>
    <verse num="54">And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</verse>
    <verse num="55">And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</verse>
    <verse num="56">And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="57">And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy <i>corn;</i> because that the famine was so sore in all lands.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="42">
    <verse num="1">Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="4">But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the sons of Israel came to buy <i>corn</i> among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Joseph <i>was</i> the governor over the land, <i>and</i> he <i>it was</i> that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him <i>with</i> their faces to the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.</verse>
    <verse num="11">We <i>are</i> all one man’s sons; we <i>are</i> true <i>men,</i> thy servants are no spies.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And they said, Thy servants <i>are</i> twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest <i>is</i> this day with our father, and one <i>is</i> not.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Joseph said unto them, That <i>is it</i> that I spake unto you, saying, Ye <i>are</i> spies:</verse>
    <verse num="15">Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether <i>there be any</i> truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye <i>are</i> spies.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he put them all together into ward three days.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; <i>for</i> I fear God:</verse>
    <verse num="19">If ye <i>be</i> true <i>men,</i> let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:</verse>
    <verse num="20">But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And they said one to another, We <i>are</i> verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And they knew not that Joseph understood <i>them;</i> for he spake unto them by an interpreter.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it <i>was</i> in his sack’s mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, <i>it is</i> even in my sack: and their heart failed <i>them,</i> and they were afraid, saying one to another, What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> God hath done unto us?</verse>
    <verse num="29">And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,</verse>
    <verse num="30">The man, <i>who is</i> the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And we said unto him, We <i>are</i> true <i>men;</i> we are no spies:</verse>
    <verse num="32">We <i>be</i> twelve brethren, sons of our father; one <i>is</i> not, and the youngest <i>is</i> this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye <i>are</i> true <i>men;</i> leave one of your brethren <i>here</i> with me, and take <i>food for</i> the famine of your households, and be gone:</verse>
    <verse num="34">And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye <i>are</i> no spies, but <i>that</i> ye <i>are</i> true <i>men: so</i> will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money <i>was</i> in his sack: and when <i>both</i> they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved <i>of my children:</i> Joseph <i>is</i> not, and Simeon <i>is</i> not, and ye will take Benjamin <i>away:</i> all these things are against me.</verse>
    <verse num="37">And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.</verse>
    <verse num="38">And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="43">
    <verse num="1">And the famine <i>was</i> sore in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <i>be</i> with you.</verse>
    <verse num="4">If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:</verse>
    <verse num="5">But if thou wilt not send <i>him,</i> we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <i>be</i> with you.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?</verse>
    <verse num="7">And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, <i>Is</i> your father yet alive? have ye <i>another</i> brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, <i>and</i> also our little ones.</verse>
    <verse num="9">I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:</verse>
    <verse num="10">For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And their father Israel said unto them, If <i>it must be</i> so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</verse>
    <verse num="12">And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry <i>it</i> again in your hand; peradventure it <i>was</i> an oversight:</verse>
    <verse num="13">Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:</verse>
    <verse num="14">And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved <i>of my children,</i> I am bereaved.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring <i>these</i> men home, and slay, and make ready; for <i>these</i> men shall dine with me at noon.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</verse>
    <verse num="20">And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</verse>
    <verse num="21">And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, <i>every</i> man’s money <i>was</i> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And he said, Peace <i>be</i> to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave <i>them</i> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which <i>was</i> in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And he asked them of <i>their</i> welfare, and said, <i>Is</i> your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? <i>Is</i> he yet alive?</verse>
    <verse num="28">And they answered, Thy servant our father <i>is</i> in good health, he <i>is</i> yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, <i>Is</i> this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought <i>where</i> to weep; and he entered into <i>his</i> chamber, and wept there.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</verse>
    <verse num="32">And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that <i>is</i> an abomination unto the Egyptians.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And he took <i>and sent</i> messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="44">
    <verse num="1">And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks <i>with</i> food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</verse>
    <verse num="3">As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</verse>
    <verse num="4"><i>And</i> when they were gone out of the city, <i>and</i> not <i>yet</i> far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</verse>
    <verse num="5"><i>Is</i> not this <i>it</i> in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:</verse>
    <verse num="8">Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?</verse>
    <verse num="9">With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And he said, Now also <i>let</i> it <i>be</i> according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And he searched, <i>and</i> began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he <i>was</i> yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And Joseph said unto them, What deed <i>is</i> this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we <i>are</i> my lord’s servants, both we, and <i>he</i> also with whom the cup is found.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And he said, God forbid that I should do so: <i>but</i> the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou <i>art</i> even as Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="19">My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</verse>
    <verse num="20">And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for <i>if</i> he should leave his father, <i>his father</i> would die.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And our father said, Go again, <i>and</i> buy us a little food.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother <i>be</i> with us.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two <i>sons: </i></verse>
    <verse num="28">And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</verse>
    <verse num="29">And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad <i>be</i> not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;</verse>
    <verse num="31">It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad <i>is</i> not <i>with us,</i> that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</verse>
    <verse num="32">For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="34">For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad <i>be</i> not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</verse>

  <chapter num="45">
    <verse num="1">Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Joseph said unto his brethren, I <i>am</i> Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I <i>am</i> Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For these two years <i>hath</i> the famine <i>been</i> in the land: and yet <i>there are</i> five years, in the which <i>there shall</i> neither <i>be</i> earing nor harvest.</verse>

    <verse num="14">And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;</verse>
    <verse num="18">And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt <i>is</i> yours.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.</verse>
    <verse num="22">To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred <i>pieces</i> of silver, and five changes of raiment.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And to his father he sent after this <i>manner;</i> ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.</verse>
    <verse num="24">So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,</verse>
    <verse num="26">And told him, saying, Joseph <i>is</i> yet alive, and he <i>is</i> governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed them not.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Israel said, <i>It is</i> enough; Joseph my son <i>is</i> yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</verse>

  <chapter num="46">
    <verse num="1">And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.</verse>

  <chapter num="47">
    <verse num="1">Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they <i>are</i> in the land of Goshen.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And he took some of his brethren, <i>even</i> five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What <i>is</i> your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants <i>are</i> shepherds, both we, <i>and</i> also our fathers.</verse>
    <verse num="4">They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine <i>is</i> sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:</verse>
    <verse num="6">The land of Egypt <i>is</i> before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest <i>any</i> men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old <i>art</i> thou?</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage <i>are</i> an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to <i>their</i> families.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And <i>there was</i> no bread in all the land; for the famine <i>was</i> very sore, so that the land of Egypt and <i>all</i> the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread <i>in exchange</i> for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.</verse>
    <verse num="18">When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide <i>it</i> from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:</verse>
    <verse num="19">Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give <i>us</i> seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And as for the people, he removed them to cities from <i>one</i> end of the borders of Egypt even to the <i>other</i> end thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion <i>assigned them</i> of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, <i>here is</i> seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth <i>part</i> unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.</verse>
    <verse num="25">And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, <i>that</i> Pharaoh should have the fifth <i>part;</i> except the land of the priests only, <i>which</i> became not Pharaoh’s.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:</verse>
    <verse num="30">But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="48">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass after these things, that <i>one</i> told Joseph, Behold, thy father <i>is</i> sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And <i>one</i> told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</verse>
    <verse num="4">And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee <i>for</i> an everlasting possession.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, <i>are</i> mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, <i>and</i> shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet <i>there was</i> but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who <i>are</i> these?</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Joseph said unto his father, They <i>are</i> my sons, whom God hath given me in this <i>place.</i> And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, <i>so that</i> he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought <i>them</i> near unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who <i>was</i> the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh <i>was</i> the firstborn.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</verse>
    <verse num="16">The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this <i>is</i> the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And his father refused, and said, I know <i>it,</i> my son, I know <i>it:</i> he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</verse>

    <verse num="6">O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Cursed <i>be</i> their anger, for <i>it was</i> fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Judah, thou <i>art he</i> whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand <i>shall be</i> in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.</verse>

    <verse num="1">And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="5">My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</verse>

    <verse num="8">And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which <i>is</i> beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This <i>is</i> a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which <i>is</i> beyond Jordan.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</verse>
    <verse num="13">For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="17">So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</verse>
