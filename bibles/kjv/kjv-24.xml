  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that <i>were</i> in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
    <verse num="2">To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
    <verse num="3">It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="5">Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, <i>and</i> I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I <i>am</i> a child.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I <i>am</i> a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Be not afraid of their faces: for I <i>am</i> with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</verse>
    <verse num="10">See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof <i>is</i> toward the north.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I <i>am</i> with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land <i>that was</i> not sown.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Israel <i>was</i> holiness unto the LORD, <i>and</i> the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:</verse>
    <verse num="5">Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</verse>
    <verse num="6">Neither said they, Where <i>is</i> the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?</verse>
    <verse num="7">And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The priests said not, Where <i>is</i> the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after <i>things that</i> do not profit.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children’s children will I plead.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Hath a nation changed <i>their</i> gods, which <i>are</i> yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for <i>that which</i> doth not profit.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, <i>and</i> hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</verse>
    <verse num="14"><i>Is</i> Israel a servant? <i>is</i> he a homeborn <i>slave?</i> why is he spoiled?</verse>
    <verse num="15">The young lions roared upon him, <i>and</i> yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?</verse>
    <verse num="18">And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?</verse>
    <verse num="19">Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that <i>it is</i> an evil <i>thing</i> and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear <i>is</i> not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</verse>
    <verse num="20">For of old time I have broken thy yoke, <i>and</i> burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</verse>
    <verse num="22">For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much sope, <i>yet</i> thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
    <verse num="23">How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: <i>thou art</i> a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</verse>
    <verse num="24">A wild ass used to the wilderness, <i>that</i> snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</verse>
    <verse num="26">As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</verse>
    <verse num="27">Saying to a stock, Thou <i>art</i> my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned <i>their</i> back unto me, and not <i>their</i> face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</verse>
    <verse num="28">But where <i>are</i> thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for <i>according to</i> the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="30">In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
    <verse num="31">O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?</verse>
    <verse num="32">Can a maid forget her ornaments, <i>or</i> a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</verse>
    <verse num="33">Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.</verse>
    <verse num="34">Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.</verse>
    <verse num="36">Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</verse>
    <verse num="37">Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth?</verse>
    <verse num="5">Will he reserve <i>his anger</i> for ever? will he keep <i>it</i> to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.</verse>
    <verse num="6">The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen <i>that</i> which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And I said after she had done all these <i>things,</i> Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="8">And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; <i>and</i> I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I <i>am</i> merciful, saith the LORD, <i>and</i> I will not keep <i>anger</i> for ever.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit <i>it;</i> neither shall <i>that</i> be done any more.</verse>
    <verse num="17">At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.</verse>
    <verse num="18">In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.</verse>
    <verse num="19">But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Surely <i>as</i> a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="21">A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping <i>and</i> supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, <i>and</i> they have forgotten the LORD their God.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Return, ye backsliding children, <i>and</i> I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou <i>art</i> the LORD our God.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Truly in vain <i>is salvation hoped for</i> from the hills, <i>and from</i> the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God <i>is</i> the salvation of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="24">For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
    <verse num="25">We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench <i>it,</i> because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; <i>and</i> thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, <i>that</i> the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.</verse>
    <verse num="11">At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,</verse>
    <verse num="12"><i>Even </i>a full wind from those <i>places </i>shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots <i>shall be</i> as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.</verse>
    <verse num="14">O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</verse>
    <verse num="15">For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, <i>that</i> watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="17">As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Thy way and thy doings have procured these <i>things</i> unto thee; this <i>is</i> thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.</verse>
    <verse num="19">My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trump, the alarm of war.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, <i>and</i> my curtains in a moment.</verse>
    <verse num="21">How long shall I see the standard, <i>and</i> hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
    <verse num="22">For my people <i>is</i> foolish, they have not known me; they <i>are</i> sottish children, and they have none understanding: they <i>are</i> wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</verse>
    <verse num="23">I beheld the earth, and, lo, <i>it was</i> without form, and void; and the heavens, and they <i>had</i> no light.</verse>
    <verse num="24">I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.</verse>
    <verse num="25">I beheld, and, lo, <i>there was</i> no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.</verse>
    <verse num="26">I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place <i>was</i> a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, <i>and</i> by his fierce anger.</verse>
    <verse num="27">For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.</verse>
    <verse num="28">For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken <i>it,</i> I have purposed <i>it,</i> and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.</verse>
    <verse num="29">The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city <i>shall be</i> forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.</verse>
    <verse num="30">And <i>when</i> thou <i>art</i> spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; <i>thy</i> lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.</verse>
    <verse num="31">For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, <i>and</i> the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, <i>that</i> bewaileth herself, <i>that</i> spreadeth her hands, <i>saying,</i> Woe <i>is</i> me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be <i>any</i> that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.</verse>
    <verse num="3">O LORD, <i>are</i> not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, <i>but</i> they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Therefore I said, Surely these <i>are</i> poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, <i>nor</i> the judgment of their God.</verse>
    <verse num="5">I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, <i>and</i> the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, <i>and</i> burst the bonds.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, <i>and</i> a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, <i>and</i> their backslidings are increased.</verse>
    <verse num="7">How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by <i>them that are</i> no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots’ houses.</verse>
    <verse num="8">They were <i>as</i> fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour’s wife.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Shall I not visit for these <i>things?</i> saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</verse>
    <verse num="10">Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they <i>are</i> not the LORD’S.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="12">They have belied the LORD, and said, <i>It is</i> not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the prophets shall become wind, and the word <i>is</i> not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it <i>is</i> a mighty nation, it <i>is</i> an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Their quiver <i>is</i> as an open sepulchre, they <i>are</i> all mighty men.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, <i>which</i> thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these <i>things</i> unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land <i>that is</i> not yours.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="21">Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:</verse>
    <verse num="22">Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand <i>for</i> the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?</verse>
    <verse num="23">But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Your iniquities have turned away these <i>things,</i> and your sins have withholden good <i>things</i> from you.</verse>
    <verse num="26">For among my people are found wicked <i>men:</i> they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.</verse>
    <verse num="27">As a cage is full of birds, so <i>are</i> their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.</verse>
    <verse num="28">They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.</verse>
    <verse num="29">Shall I not visit for these <i>things?</i> saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</verse>
    <verse num="30">A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;</verse>
    <verse num="31">The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love <i>to have it</i> so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.</verse>
    <verse num="2">I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate <i>woman. </i></verse>
    <verse num="3">The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch <i>their</i> tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this <i>is</i> the city to be visited; she <i>is</i> wholly oppression in the midst of her.</verse>
    <verse num="7">As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</verse>
    <verse num="10">To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear <i>is</i> uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with <i>him that is</i> full of days.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And their houses shall be turned unto others, <i>with their</i> fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one <i>is</i> given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</verse>
    <verse num="14">They have healed also the hurt <i>of the daughter</i> of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when <i>there is</i> no peace.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time <i>that</i> I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk <i>therein. </i></verse>
    <verse num="17">Also I set watchmen over you, <i>saying,</i> Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what <i>is</i> among them.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, <i>even</i> the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</verse>
    <verse num="20">To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings <i>are</i> not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="23">They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they <i>are</i> cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.</verse>
    <verse num="24">We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, <i>and</i> pain, as of a woman in travail.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy <i>and</i> fear <i>is</i> on every side.</verse>
    <verse num="26">O daughter of my people, gird <i>thee</i> with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, <i>as for</i> an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.</verse>
    <verse num="27">I have set thee <i>for</i> a tower <i>and</i> a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</verse>
    <verse num="28">They <i>are</i> all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: <i>they are</i> brass and iron; they <i>are</i> all corrupters.</verse>
    <verse num="29">The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.</verse>

    <verse num="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="1">At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:</verse>

    <verse num="3">And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>

    <verse num="5">They <i>are</i> upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also <i>is it</i> in them to do good.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put <i>it</i> on my loins.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="4">Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;</verse>
    <verse num="5">They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire <i>for</i> burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake <i>it,</i> neither came <i>it</i> into my mind:</verse>
    <verse num="6">Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,</verse>
    <verse num="11">And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as <i>one</i> breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury <i>them</i> in Tophet, till <i>there be</i> no place to bury.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and <i>even</i> make this city as Tophet:</verse>
    <verse num="13">And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD’S house; and said to all the people,</verse>
    <verse num="15">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.</verse>

  <chapter num="20">
    <verse num="1">Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who <i>was</i> also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that <i>were</i> in the high gate of Benjamin, which <i>was</i> by the house of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold <i>it:</i> and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.</verse>
    <verse num="7">O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But <i>his word</i> was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not <i>stay.</i></verse>
    <verse num="10">For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, <i>say they,</i> and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, <i>saying,</i> Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But the LORD <i>is</i> with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: <i>their</i> everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.</verse>
    <verse num="12">But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, <i>and</i> seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Cursed <i>be</i> the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Cursed <i>be</i> the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;</verse>
    <verse num="17">Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb <i>to be</i> always great <i>with me. </i></verse>
    <verse num="18">Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</verse>

  <chapter num="21">
    <verse num="1">The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:</verse>
    <verse num="4">Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that <i>are</i> in your hands, wherewith ye fight <i>against</i> the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.</verse>
    <verse num="9">He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD;</verse>
    <verse num="12">O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver <i>him that is</i> spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench <i>it,</i> because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, <i>and</i> rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?</verse>
    <verse num="14">But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="22">
    <verse num="1">Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,</verse>
    <verse num="2">And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates:</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For thus saith the LORD unto the king’s house of Judah; Thou <i>art</i> Gilead unto me, <i>and</i> the head of Lebanon: <i>yet</i> surely I will make thee a wilderness, <i>and</i> cities <i>which</i> are not inhabited.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast <i>them</i> into the fire.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: <i>but</i> weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:</verse>
    <verse num="12">But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; <i>that</i> useth his neighbour’s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;</verse>
    <verse num="14">That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and <i>it is</i> cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Shalt thou reign, because thou closest <i>thyself</i> in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, <i>and</i> then <i>it was</i> well with him?</verse>
    <verse num="16">He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then <i>it was</i> well <i>with him: was</i> not this to know me? saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But thine eyes and thine heart <i>are</i> not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="18">Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, <i>saying,</i> Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, <i>saying,</i> Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</verse>
    <verse num="19">He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.</verse>
    <verse num="21">I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; <i>but</i> thou saidst, I will not hear. This <i>hath been</i> thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.</verse>
    <verse num="22">The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.</verse>
    <verse num="23">O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!</verse>
    <verse num="24"><i>As</i> I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;</verse>
    <verse num="25">And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand <i>of them</i> whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
    <verse num="26">And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.</verse>
    <verse num="27">But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.</verse>
    <verse num="28"><i>Is</i> this man Coniah a despised broken idol? <i>is he</i> a vessel wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?</verse>
    <verse num="29">O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man <i>that</i> shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.</verse>

    <verse num="1">Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="6">In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this <i>is</i> his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</verse>
    <verse num="8">But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force <i>is</i> not right.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery <i>ways</i> in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, <i>even</i> the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.</verse>
    <verse num="14">I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, <i>and</i> not out of the mouth of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="17">They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard <i>it? </i></verse>
    <verse num="19">Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.</verse>
    <verse num="20">The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.</verse>
    <verse num="21">I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.</verse>
    <verse num="22">But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</verse>
    <verse num="23"><i>Am</i> I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?</verse>
    <verse num="24">Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="25">I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</verse>
    <verse num="26">How long shall <i>this</i> be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, <i>they are</i> prophets of the deceit of their own heart;</verse>
    <verse num="27">Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.</verse>
    <verse num="28">The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What <i>is</i> the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.</verse>

    <verse num="31">Behold, I <i>am</i> against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Behold, I <i>am</i> against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What <i>is</i> the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And <i>as for</i> the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?</verse>
    <verse num="36">And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man’s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.</verse>

    <verse num="1">The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs <i>were</i> set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="2">One basket <i>had</i> very good figs, <i>even</i> like the figs <i>that are</i> first ripe: and the other basket <i>had</i> very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</verse>

    <verse num="28">And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.</verse>

  <chapter num="26">
    <verse num="1">In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD’S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD’S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</verse>
    <verse num="3">If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,</verse>
    <verse num="5">To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending <i>them,</i> but ye have not hearkened;</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded <i>him</i> to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="10">When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king’s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S <i>house. </i></verse>
    <verse num="11">Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man <i>is</i> worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</verse>
    <verse num="14">As for me, behold, I <i>am</i> in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man <i>is</i> not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="18">Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed <i>like</i> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</verse>
    <verse num="21">And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;</verse>
    <verse num="22">And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, <i>namely,</i> Elnathan the son of Achbor, and <i>certain</i> men with him into Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="27">
    <verse num="1">In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,</verse>
    <verse num="3">And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;</verse>
    <verse num="4">And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;</verse>
    <verse num="5">I have made the earth, the man and the beast that <i>are</i> upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:</verse>
    <verse num="10">For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.</verse>
    <verse num="12">I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</verse>
    <verse num="14">Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?</verse>
    <verse num="18">But if they <i>be</i> prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and <i>in</i> the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="19">For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city,</verse>
    <verse num="20">Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;</verse>
    <verse num="21">Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain <i>in</i> the house of the LORD, and <i>in</i> the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;</verse>
    <verse num="22">They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="28">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, <i>and</i> in the fifth month, <i>that</i> Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which <i>was</i> of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,</verse>
    <verse num="6">Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD’S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;</verse>
    <verse num="8">The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</verse>
    <verse num="9">The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, <i>then</i> shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah <i>the prophet,</i> after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="13">Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="17">So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="29">
    <verse num="1">Now these <i>are</i> the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;</verse>
    <verse num="2">(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)</verse>
    <verse num="3">By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,</verse>
    <verse num="4">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;</verse>
    <verse num="5">Build ye houses, and dwell <i>in them;</i> and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;</verse>
    <verse num="6">Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that <i>be</i> in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And ye shall seek me, and find <i>me,</i> when ye shall search for me with all your heart.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;</verse>
    <verse num="16"><i>Know</i> that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, <i>and</i> of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;</verse>
    <verse num="17">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:</verse>
    <verse num="19">Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending <i>them;</i> but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="20">Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:</verse>
    <verse num="21">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;</verse>
    <verse num="22">And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which <i>are</i> in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;</verse>
    <verse num="23">Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and <i>am</i> a witness, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="24"><i>Thus</i> shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="25">Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that <i>are</i> at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="26">The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man <i>that is</i> mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?</verse>
    <verse num="28">For therefore he sent unto us <i>in</i> Babylon, saying, This <i>captivity is</i> long: build ye houses, and dwell <i>in them;</i> and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</verse>
    <verse num="30">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="31">Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:</verse>
    <verse num="32">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="30">
    <verse num="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And these <i>are</i> the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</verse>
    <verse num="7">Alas! for that day <i>is</i> great, so that none <i>is</i> like it: it <i>is</i> even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, <i>that</i> I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</verse>
    <verse num="9">But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make <i>him</i> afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For I <i>am</i> with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</verse>
    <verse num="12">For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise <i>is</i> incurable, <i>and</i> thy wound <i>is</i> grievous.</verse>
    <verse num="13"><i>There is</i> none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</verse>
    <verse num="14">All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; <i>because</i> thy sins were increased.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow <i>is</i> incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: <i>because</i> thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, <i>saying,</i> This <i>is</i> Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</verse>

    <verse num="20">Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who <i>is</i> this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</verse>

    <verse num="7">For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, <i>and</i> with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.</verse>
    <verse num="9">They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim <i>is</i> my firstborn.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare <i>it</i> in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd <i>doth</i> his flock.</verse>
    <verse num="11">For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of <i>him that was</i> stronger than he.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, <i>and</i> bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they <i>were</i> not.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.</verse>
    <verse num="18">I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself <i>thus;</i> Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed <i>to the yoke:</i> turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou <i>art</i> the LORD my God.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon <i>my</i> thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.</verse>
    <verse num="20"><i>Is</i> Ephraim my dear son? <i>is he</i> a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, <i>even</i> the way <i>which</i> thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.</verse>
    <verse num="22">How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, <i>and</i> mountain of holiness.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they <i>that</i> go forth with flocks.</verse>
    <verse num="25">For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.</verse>
    <verse num="28">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="29">In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.</verse>
    <verse num="30">But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.</verse>
    <verse num="31">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</verse>
    <verse num="32">Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day <i>that</i> I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:</verse>
    <verse num="33">But this <i>shall be</i> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</verse>
    <verse num="34">And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.</verse>
    <verse num="35">Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, <i>and</i> the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name:</verse>
    <verse num="36">If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, <i>then</i> the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.</verse>
    <verse num="37">Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="38">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.</verse>
    <verse num="39">And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.</verse>
    <verse num="40">And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, <i>shall be</i> holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.</verse>

  <chapter num="32">
    <verse num="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which <i>was</i> the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</verse>
    <verse num="2">For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which <i>was</i> in the king of Judah’s house.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</verse>
    <verse num="4">And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</verse>
    <verse num="5">And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="7">Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that <i>is</i> in Anathoth: for the right of redemption <i>is</i> thine to buy <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="8">So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that <i>is</i> in Anathoth, which <i>is</i> in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance <i>is</i> thine, and the redemption <i>is</i> thine; buy <i>it</i> for thyself. Then I knew that this <i>was</i> the word of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that <i>was</i> in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, <i>even</i> seventeen shekels of silver.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed <i>it,</i> and took witnesses, and weighed <i>him</i> the money in the balances.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So I took the evidence of the purchase, <i>both</i> that which was sealed <i>according</i> to the law and custom, and that which was open:</verse>
    <verse num="12">And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s <i>son,</i> and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="14">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.</verse>
    <verse num="15">For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="17">Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, <i>and</i> there is nothing too hard for thee:</verse>
    <verse num="18">Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, <i>is</i> his name,</verse>
    <verse num="19">Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes <i>are</i> open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:</verse>
    <verse num="20">Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, <i>even</i> unto this day, and in Israel, and among <i>other</i> men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;</verse>
    <verse num="21">And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;</verse>
    <verse num="22">And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</verse>
    <verse num="23">And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:</verse>
    <verse num="24">Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest <i>it. </i></verse>
    <verse num="25">And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="27">Behold, I <i>am</i> the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?</verse>
    <verse num="28">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</verse>
    <verse num="29">And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.</verse>
    <verse num="30">For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="31">For this city hath been to me <i>as</i> a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</verse>
    <verse num="32">Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="33">And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching <i>them,</i> yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</verse>
    <verse num="34">But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.</verse>
    <verse num="35">And they built the high places of Baal, which <i>are</i> in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through <i>the fire</i> unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</verse>
    <verse num="36">And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;</verse>
    <verse num="37">Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</verse>
    <verse num="38">And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</verse>
    <verse num="39">And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</verse>
    <verse num="40">And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</verse>
    <verse num="41">Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</verse>
    <verse num="42">For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</verse>
    <verse num="43">And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, <i>It is</i> desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
    <verse num="44">Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal <i>them,</i> and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="33">
    <verse num="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD <i>is</i> his name;</verse>
    <verse num="3">Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;</verse>
    <verse num="5">They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but <i>it is</i> fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say <i>shall be</i> desolate without man and without beast, <i>even</i> in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,</verse>
    <verse num="11">The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD <i>is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever: <i>and</i> of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing <i>their</i> flocks to lie down.</verse>
    <verse num="13">In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth <i>them,</i> saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="15">In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="16">In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this <i>is the name</i> wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;</verse>
    <verse num="18">Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="20">Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;</verse>
    <verse num="21"><i>Then</i> may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</verse>
    <verse num="22">As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="24">Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, <i>and if</i> I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take <i>any</i> of his seed <i>to be</i> rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.</verse>

  <chapter num="34">
    <verse num="1">The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:</verse>
    <verse num="5"><i>But</i> thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn <i>odours</i> for thee; and they will lament thee, <i>saying,</i> Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</verse>
    <verse num="7">When the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="8"><i>This is</i> the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which <i>were</i> at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;</verse>
    <verse num="9">That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, <i>being</i> an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, <i>to wit,</i> of a Jew his brother.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let <i>them</i> go.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="13">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="14">At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:</verse>
    <verse num="16">But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,</verse>
    <verse num="19">The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;</verse>
    <verse num="20">I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from you.</verse>

    <verse num="1">The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which <i>was</i> by the chamber of the princes, which <i>was</i> above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:</verse>
    <verse num="5">And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.</verse>
    <verse num="6">But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, <i>neither</i> ye, nor your sons for ever:</verse>
    <verse num="7">Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have <i>any:</i> but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye <i>be</i> strangers.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;</verse>
    <verse num="9">Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:</verse>
    <verse num="10">But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="14">The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="15">I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending <i>them,</i> saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:</verse>

    <verse num="18">And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:</verse>

    <verse num="10">Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S house, in the ears of all the people.</verse>
    <verse num="11">When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, <i>even</i> Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read <i>it</i> in their ears.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</verse>
    <verse num="17">And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?</verse>
    <verse num="18">Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote <i>them</i> with ink in the book.</verse>
    <verse num="19">Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.</verse>
    <verse num="20">And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.</verse>
    <verse num="21">So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.</verse>
    <verse num="22">Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and <i>there was a fire</i> on the hearth burning before him.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast <i>it</i> into the fire that <i>was</i> on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that <i>was</i> on the hearth.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, <i>neither</i> the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.</verse>
    <verse num="25">Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.</verse>
    <verse num="26">But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="28">Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim the king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</verse>
    <verse num="30">Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.</verse>
    <verse num="32">Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="37">
    <verse num="1">And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="7">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained <i>but</i> wounded men among them, <i>yet</i> should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward <i>was</i> there, whose name <i>was</i> Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then said Jeremiah, <i>It is</i> false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</verse>
    <verse num="16">When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there <i>any</i> word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?</verse>
    <verse num="19">Where <i>are</i> now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</verse>
    <verse num="20">Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</verse>
    <verse num="21">Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="38">
    <verse num="1">Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king <i>is</i> not <i>he that</i> can do <i>any</i> thing against you.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that <i>was</i> in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon <i>there was</i> no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;</verse>
    <verse num="8">Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for <i>there is</i> no more bread in the city.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</verse>
    <verse num="11">So Ebed- melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now <i>these</i> old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that <i>is</i> in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare <i>it</i> unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?</verse>
    <verse num="16">So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:</verse>
    <verse num="18">But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.</verse>
    <verse num="20">But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver <i>thee.</i> Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.</verse>
    <verse num="21">But if thou refuse to go forth, this <i>is</i> the word that the LORD hath shewed me:</verse>
    <verse num="22">And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house <i>shall be</i> brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those <i>women</i> shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, <i>and</i> they are turned away back.</verse>
    <verse num="23">So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</verse>
    <verse num="25">But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:</verse>
    <verse num="26">Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</verse>
    <verse num="28">So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was <i>there</i> when Jerusalem was taken.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="39">
    <verse num="1">In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</verse>
    <verse num="2"><i>And</i> in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth <i>day</i> of the month, the city was broken up.</verse>
    <verse num="3">And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, <i>even</i> Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab- saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="8">And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.</verse>
    <verse num="10">But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="12">Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="13">So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;</verse>
    <verse num="14">Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="16">Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be <i>accomplished</i> in that day before thee.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou <i>art</i> afraid.</verse>
    <verse num="18">For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="40">
    <verse num="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Now the LORD hath brought <i>it,</i> and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which <i>were</i> upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land <i>is</i> before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Now while he was not yet gone back, <i>he said,</i> Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Now when all the captains of the forces which <i>were</i> in the fields, <i>even</i> they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</verse>
    <verse num="10">As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put <i>them</i> in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Likewise when all the Jews that <i>were</i> in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that <i>were</i> in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;</verse>
    <verse num="12">Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that <i>were</i> in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,</verse>
    <verse num="14">And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know <i>it:</i> wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?</verse>
    <verse num="16">But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="41">
    <verse num="1">Now it came to pass in the seventh month, <i>that</i> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, <i>even</i> with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, <i>and</i> the men of war.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew <i>it, </i></verse>
    <verse num="5">That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, <i>even</i> fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring <i>them</i> to the house of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And it was <i>so,</i> when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, <i>and cast them</i> into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that <i>were</i> with him.</verse>
    <verse num="8">But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, <i>was</i> it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: <i>and</i> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with <i>them that were</i> slain.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that <i>were</i> in Mizpah, <i>even</i> the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.</verse>
    <verse num="11">But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that <i>were</i> with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</verse>
    <verse num="12">Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that <i>are</i> in Gibeon.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Now it came to pass, <i>that</i> when all the people which <i>were</i> with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that <i>were</i> with him, then they were glad.</verse>
    <verse num="14">So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.</verse>
    <verse num="15">But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that <i>were</i> with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after <i>that</i> he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, <i>even</i> mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:</verse>
    <verse num="17">And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,</verse>
    <verse num="18">Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="42">
    <verse num="1">Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,</verse>
    <verse num="2">And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, <i>even</i> for all this remnant; (for we are left <i>but</i> a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)</verse>
    <verse num="3">That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard <i>you;</i> behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare <i>it</i> unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Whether <i>it be</i> good, or whether <i>it be</i> evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which <i>were</i> with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,</verse>

    <verse num="11">Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I <i>am</i> with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.</verse>
    <verse num="13">But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,</verse>
    <verse num="14">Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:</verse>
    <verse num="15">And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;</verse>
    <verse num="16">Then it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.</verse>

    <verse num="19">The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.</verse>

  <chapter num="43">
    <verse num="1">And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, <i>even</i> all these words,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:</verse>
    <verse num="3">But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="4">So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;</verse>
    <verse num="6"><i>Even</i> men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.</verse>
    <verse num="7">So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they <i>even</i> to Tahpanhes.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="9">Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which <i>is</i> at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;</verse>
    <verse num="10">And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, <i>and deliver</i> such <i>as are</i> for death to death; and such <i>as are</i> for captivity to captivity; and such <i>as are</i> for the sword to the sword.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</verse>
    <verse num="13">He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that <i>is</i> in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="44">
    <verse num="1">The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="2">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they <i>are</i> a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,</verse>
    <verse num="3">Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, <i>and</i> to serve other gods, whom they knew not, <i>neither</i> they, ye, nor your fathers.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending <i>them,</i> saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.</verse>
    <verse num="5">But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted <i>and</i> desolate, as at this day.</verse>
    <verse num="7">Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye <i>this</i> great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;</verse>
    <verse num="8">In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</verse>
    <verse num="9">Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</verse>
    <verse num="10">They are not humbled <i>even</i> unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, <i>and</i> fall in the land of Egypt; they shall <i>even</i> be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword <i>and</i> by the famine: and they shall be an execration, <i>and</i> an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.</verse>
    <verse num="13">For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:</verse>
    <verse num="14">So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="16"><i>As for</i> the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.</verse>
    <verse num="17">But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for <i>then</i> had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.</verse>
    <verse num="18">But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all <i>things,</i> and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?</verse>
    <verse num="20">Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him <i>that</i> answer, saying,</verse>
    <verse num="21">The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it <i>not</i> into his mind?</verse>
    <verse num="22">So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, <i>and</i> because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</verse>
    <verse num="23">Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.</verse>
    <verse num="24">Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that <i>are</i> in the land of Egypt:</verse>
    <verse num="25">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.</verse>
    <verse num="26">Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.</verse>
    <verse num="27">Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</verse>
    <verse num="28">Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.</verse>
    <verse num="29">And this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:</verse>
    <verse num="30">Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.</verse>

    <verse num="1">The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,</verse>

    <verse num="9">Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Now in the fifth month, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, which <i>was</i> the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, <i>which</i> served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,</verse>
    <verse num="13">And burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great <i>men,</i> burned he with fire:</verse>
    <verse num="14">And all the army of the Chaldeans, that <i>were</i> with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive <i>certain</i> of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</verse>
    <verse num="16">But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left <i>certain</i> of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Also the pillars of brass that <i>were</i> in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that <i>was</i> in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</verse>
    <verse num="18">The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> of gold <i>in</i> gold, and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> of silver <i>in</i> silver, took the captain of the guard away.</verse>
    <verse num="20">The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that <i>were</i> under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And <i>concerning</i> the pillars, the height of one pillar <i>was</i> eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof <i>was</i> four fingers: <i>it was</i> hollow.</verse>
    <verse num="22">And a chapiter of brass <i>was</i> upon it; and the height of one chapiter <i>was</i> five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates <i>were</i> like unto these.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; <i>and</i> all the pomegranates upon the network <i>were</i> an hundred round about.</verse>
    <verse num="24">And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</verse>
    <verse num="25">He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</verse>
    <verse num="26">So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
    <verse num="27">And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.</verse>
    <verse num="28">This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</verse>
    <verse num="29">In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:</verse>
    <verse num="30">In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar- adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons <i>were</i> four thousand and six hundred.</verse>
    <verse num="31">And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the <i>first</i> year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,</verse>
    <verse num="32">And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that <i>were</i> with him in Babylon,</verse>
    <verse num="33">And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.</verse>
