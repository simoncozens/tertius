  <chapter num="1">
    <verse num="1">The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, <i>departing</i> from the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="3">So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little <i>while,</i> and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And <i>God</i> said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Then said <i>God,</i> Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye <i>are</i> not my people, and I will not be your <i>God.</i></verse>
    <verse num="10">Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> not my people, <i>there</i> it shall be said unto them, <i>Ye are</i> the sons of the living God.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great <i>shall be</i> the day of Jezreel.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="2">
    <verse num="1">Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ru-hamah.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Plead with your mother, plead: for she <i>is</i> not my wife, neither <i>am</i> I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
    <verse num="3">Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</verse>
    <verse num="4">And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they <i>be</i> the children of whoredoms.</verse>
    <verse num="5">For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give <i>me</i> my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find <i>them:</i> then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then <i>was it</i> better with me than now.</verse>
    <verse num="8">For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, <i>which</i> they prepared for Baal.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax <i>given</i> to cover her nakedness.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.</verse>
    <verse num="11">I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</verse>
    <verse num="12">And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These <i>are</i> my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</verse>
    <verse num="13">And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</verse>
    <verse num="15">And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="16">And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, <i>that</i> thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.</verse>
    <verse num="17">For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</verse>
    <verse num="18">And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and <i>with</i> the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</verse>
    <verse num="19">And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</verse>
    <verse num="20">I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="21">And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</verse>
    <verse num="22">And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</verse>
    <verse num="23">And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to <i>them which were</i> not my people, Thou <i>art</i> my people; and they shall say, <i>Thou art</i> my God.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="3">
    <verse num="1">Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of <i>her</i> friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.</verse>
    <verse num="2">So I bought her to me for fifteen <i>pieces</i> of silver, and <i>for</i> an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:</verse>
    <verse num="3">And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for <i>another</i> man: so <i>will</i> I also <i>be</i> for thee.</verse>
    <verse num="4">For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and <i>without</i> teraphim:</verse>
    <verse num="5">Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="4">
    <verse num="1">Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because <i>there is</i> no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
    <verse num="2">By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</verse>
    <verse num="4">Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people <i>are</i> as they that strive with the priest.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</verse>
    <verse num="6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</verse>
    <verse num="7">As they were increased, so they sinned against me: <i>therefore</i> will I change their glory into shame.</verse>
    <verse num="8">They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</verse>
    <verse num="10">For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</verse>
    <verse num="12">My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused <i>them</i> to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</verse>
    <verse num="13">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof <i>is</i> good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</verse>
    <verse num="14">I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people <i>that</i> doth not understand shall fall.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, <i>yet</i> let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</verse>
    <verse num="16">For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</verse>
    <verse num="17">Ephraim <i>is</i> joined to idols: let him alone.</verse>
    <verse num="18">Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers <i>with</i> shame do love, Give ye.</verse>
    <verse num="19">The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="5">
    <verse num="1">Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment <i>is</i> toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I <i>have been</i> a rebuker of them all.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, <i>and</i> Israel is defiled.</verse>
    <verse num="4">They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms <i>is</i> in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="5">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</verse>
    <verse num="6">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find <i>him;</i> he hath withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
    <verse num="7">They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, <i>and</i> the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud <i>at</i> Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</verse>
    <verse num="10">The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: <i>therefore</i> I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Ephraim <i>is</i> oppressed <i>and</i> broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Therefore <i>will</i> I <i>be</i> unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
    <verse num="13">When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah <i>saw</i> his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For I will <i>be</i> unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, <i>even</i> I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue <i>him.</i></verse>
    <verse num="15">I will go <i>and</i> return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="6">
    <verse num="1">Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</verse>
    <verse num="2">After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Then shall we know, <i>if</i> we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter <i>and</i> former rain unto the earth.</verse>
    <verse num="4">O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness <i>is</i> as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Therefore have I hewed <i>them</i> by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments <i>are as</i> the light <i>that</i> goeth forth.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</verse>
    <verse num="7">But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Gilead <i>is</i> a city of them that work iniquity, <i>and is</i> polluted with blood.</verse>
    <verse num="9">And as troops of robbers wait for a man, <i>so</i> the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</verse>
    <verse num="10">I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there <i>is</i> the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="7">
    <verse num="1">When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, <i>and</i> the troop of robbers spoileth without.</verse>
    <verse num="2">And they consider not in their hearts <i>that</i> I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</verse>
    <verse num="3">They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</verse>
    <verse num="4">They <i>are</i> all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, <i>who</i> ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</verse>
    <verse num="5">In the day of our king the princes have made <i>him</i> sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</verse>
    <verse num="6">For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</verse>
    <verse num="7">They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: <i>there is</i> none among them that calleth unto me.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</verse>
    <verse num="9">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth <i>it</i> not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</verse>
    <verse num="10">And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</verse>
    <verse num="12">When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</verse>
    <verse num="14">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, <i>and</i> they rebel against me.</verse>
    <verse num="15">Though I have bound <i>and</i> strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</verse>
    <verse num="16">They return, <i>but</i> not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this <i>shall be</i> their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="8">
    <verse num="1"><i>Set</i> the trumpet to thy mouth. <i>He shall come</i> as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</verse>
    <verse num="3">Israel hath cast off <i>the thing that is</i> good: the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
    <verse num="4">They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew <i>it</i> not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</verse>
    <verse num="5">Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast <i>thee</i> off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long <i>will it be</i> ere they attain to innocency?</verse>
    <verse num="6">For from Israel <i>was</i> it also: the workman made it; therefore it <i>is</i> not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
    <verse num="7">For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</verse>
    <verse num="8">Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure.</verse>
    <verse num="9">For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</verse>
    <verse num="10">Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</verse>
    <verse num="11">Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</verse>
    <verse num="12">I have written to him the great things of my law, <i>but</i> they were counted as a strange thing.</verse>
    <verse num="13">They sacrifice flesh <i>for</i> the sacrifices of mine offerings, and <i>eat it;</i> but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="14">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="9">
    <verse num="1">Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as <i>other</i> people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</verse>
    <verse num="3">They shall not dwell in the LORD’S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean <i>things</i> in Assyria.</verse>
    <verse num="4">They shall not offer wine <i>offerings</i> to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices <i>shall be</i> unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="5">What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</verse>
    <verse num="6">For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant <i>places</i> for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns <i>shall be</i> in their tabernacles.</verse>
    <verse num="7">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know <i>it:</i> the prophet <i>is</i> a fool, the spiritual man <i>is</i> mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The watchman of Ephraim <i>was</i> with my God: <i>but</i> the prophet <i>is</i> a snare of a fowler in all his ways, <i>and</i> hatred in the house of his God.</verse>
    <verse num="9">They have deeply corrupted <i>themselves,</i> as in the days of Gibeah: <i>therefore</i> he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</verse>
    <verse num="10">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: <i>but</i> they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto <i>that</i> shame; and <i>their</i> abominations were according as they loved.</verse>
    <verse num="11"><i>As for</i> Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, <i>that there shall</i> not <i>be</i> a man <i>left:</i> yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</verse>
    <verse num="13">Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, <i>is</i> planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</verse>
    <verse num="15">All their wickedness <i>is</i> in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes <i>are</i> revolters.</verse>
    <verse num="16">Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay <i>even</i> the beloved <i>fruit</i> of their womb.</verse>
    <verse num="17">My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="10">
    <verse num="1">Israel <i>is</i> an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.</verse>
    <verse num="2">Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</verse>
    <verse num="3">For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</verse>
    <verse num="4">They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</verse>
    <verse num="5">The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof <i>that</i> rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</verse>
    <verse num="6">It shall be also carried unto Assyria <i>for</i> a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</verse>
    <verse num="7"><i>As for</i> Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</verse>
    <verse num="8">The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</verse>
    <verse num="9">O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</verse>
    <verse num="10"><i>It is</i> in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.</verse>
    <verse num="11">And Ephraim <i>is as</i> an heifer <i>that is</i> taught, <i>and</i> loveth to tread out <i>the corn;</i> but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, <i>and</i> Jacob shall break his clods.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for <i>it is</i> time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</verse>
    <verse num="13">Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</verse>
    <verse num="14">Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth- arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon <i>her</i> children.</verse>
    <verse num="15">So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="11">
    <verse num="1">When Israel <i>was</i> a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="2"><i>As</i> they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</verse>
    <verse num="3">I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</verse>
    <verse num="4">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</verse>
    <verse num="5">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</verse>
    <verse num="6">And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour <i>them,</i> because of their own counsels.</verse>
    <verse num="7">And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt <i>him. </i></verse>
    <verse num="8">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? <i>how</i> shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? <i>how</i> shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</verse>
    <verse num="9">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I <i>am</i> God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</verse>
    <verse num="10">They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.</verse>
    <verse num="11">They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.</verse>
    <verse num="12">Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.</verse>
  </chapter>
  <chapter num="12">
    <verse num="1">Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.</verse>
    <verse num="2">The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</verse>
    <verse num="3">He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:</verse>
    <verse num="4">Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him <i>in</i> Bethel, and there he spake with us;</verse>
    <verse num="5">Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD <i>is</i> his memorial.</verse>
    <verse num="6">Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</verse>
